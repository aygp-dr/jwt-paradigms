* JWT Security Implementation Scenarios
This document outlines comprehensive security scenarios for JWT implementations based on feedback from Jason Wilson (Staff Engineer) and Hannah Chen (Application Security Architect).

** Overview
The following scenarios demonstrate secure JWT implementations addressing:
1. Secure-by-default parsing (verify-then-parse)
2. Key management and rotation
3. Algorithm confusion protection
4. Secure error handling
5. Validation pipeline
6. Defense-in-depth strategies

** Scenario 1: Secure-by-Default Parsing
*** Problem
Many JWT examples demonstrate parsing the header before validating the signature, creating a risk that developers will copy insecure patterns.

*** Solution
Replace all parsing examples with secure-by-default implementations that:
1. Verify the signature first
2. Then validate claims
3. Finally parse and use the payload

*** Implementation Examples
We'll create implementations in:
- Python
- TypeScript/JavaScript
- Rust
- Clojure/JVM
- Other languages as appropriate

** Scenario 2: Key Management and Rotation
*** Problem
Production JWT implementations require proper key management and rotation, which is often overlooked.

*** Solution
Create examples demonstrating:
1. JWK (JSON Web Key) integration
2. Key rotation mechanisms
3. Key ID (kid) handling
4. Secure key storage
5. HSM integration considerations

*** Implementation Examples
We'll create practical implementations for handling key rotation in microservice environments.

** Scenario 3: Algorithm Confusion Protection
*** Problem
Algorithm confusion attacks can allow attackers to bypass signature verification.

*** Solution
Create examples showing proper algorithm constraint verification:
1. Explicit algorithm whitelisting
2. Rejecting "none" algorithm
3. Preventing RS256/HS256 confusion
4. Type-safe algorithm handling

*** Implementation Examples
We'll demonstrate algorithm confusion prevention in multiple languages.

** Scenario 4: Secure Error Handling
*** Problem
Poor error handling can leak implementation details that help attackers.

*** Solution
Create examples of secure error handling:
1. Consistent error messages regardless of failure type
2. Proper logging without leaking sensitive information
3. Language-specific error handling patterns
4. Timing attack prevention

*** Implementation Examples
We'll implement proper error handling across languages.

** Scenario 5: Validation Pipeline
*** Problem
JWT validation involves multiple steps that must be performed in the correct order.

*** Solution
Create a validation pipeline that clearly demonstrates:
1. Signature verification first
2. Expiration/time validation second
3. Issuer/audience validation third
4. Custom claim validation last
5. Proper handling of each stage

*** Implementation Examples
We'll create pipeline implementations in functional and OO paradigms.

** Scenario 6: Defense-in-Depth Strategy
*** Problem
JWT validation alone is insufficient for robust security.

*** Solution
Demonstrate integration with:
1. Rate limiting
2. Logging and monitoring
3. Abnormal usage detection
4. Token revocation mechanisms
5. Complementary security controls

*** Implementation Examples
We'll create real-world security frameworks integrating JWT with additional protections.

* Implementation Plan
1. Create baseline implementations for each scenario
2. Develop comprehensive test cases showing correct and incorrect usage
3. Add detailed documentation and comments
4. Ensure examples are production-ready
5. Provide visual aids showing security vulnerabilities and protection

* Timeframe
The security examples should be completed by May 10, 2025, to allow integration with the presentation materials before the PyCon US 2025 presentation (May 14-22, 2025).
