# JWT Security Implementation Examples

This directory contains secure implementation examples for handling JWTs, addressing the security concerns raised in issue #52 and related security issues.

## Purpose

These examples demonstrate secure-by-default patterns for JWT handling across multiple programming languages and paradigms. The goal is to provide production-ready code that can be used as a foundation for secure JWT implementations.

## Structure

The examples are organized into the following categories:

- **secure-parsing**: Implementations that prioritize signature verification before payload access
- **key-management**: Examples of proper key management, rotation, and JWK handling
- **algorithm-protection**: Techniques to prevent algorithm confusion attacks
- **error-handling**: Secure error handling patterns that prevent information leakage
- **validation-pipeline**: Complete validation pipelines showing proper order of operations
- **defense-in-depth**: Integration with complementary security controls

## Usage

Each example is fully documented and includes:
- Complete implementations in relevant languages
- Test cases demonstrating correct usage
- Security warnings highlighting potential pitfalls
- Detailed comments explaining the security considerations

## Integration with Presentation

These examples will serve as the foundation for security improvements to the JWT presentation, ensuring that attendees learn secure-by-default patterns.

## Contributing

When adding new examples, please follow these guidelines:
1. Prioritize security over convenience
2. Include comprehensive error handling
3. Add detailed comments explaining security considerations
4. Create test cases demonstrating both correct and incorrect usage
5. Follow language-specific best practices
