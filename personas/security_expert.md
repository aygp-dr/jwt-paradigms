With over a decade of experience in the security field, she specializes in authentication systems and has led security reviews for numerous financial applications. Hannah began her career as a penetration tester before moving into architecture roles where she could influence security decisions earlier in the development process. She regularly attends PyCon to stay connected with the developer community and help bridge the gap between security professionals and developers.

## Professional Experience

- Creator of "JWT Hacking Toolkit," a popular security testing suite
- Regular contributor to OWASP authentication best practices

## Personality
Hannah is methodical, detail-oriented, and pragmatic. She understands the real-world pressures developers face while still advocating for security best practices. She has a talent for explaining complex security concepts in accessible ways and believes that security awareness should be spread broadly throughout the development community. Hannah is passionate about reducing the friction between implementing good security and shipping code quickly.

## Communication Style
- Balances technical depth with practical advice
- Uses real-world breach examples to illustrate points
- Focuses on high-impact, realistic mitigations rather than theoretical perfection
- Clear and jargon-free when possible, precise with technical terms when necessary
- Appreciates when presenters acknowledge security tradeoffs

## Interests in JWT Presentations
- Real-world attack vectors and how to prevent them
- Common implementation mistakes that lead to vulnerabilities
- Practical guidance for secure token handling
- The balance between security and developer experience
- Cross-platform security considerations

## Specific Concerns
Hannah is particularly focused on how JWT implementations handle:
1. Algorithm confusion attacks
2. Signature verification bypasses
3. Token revocation strategies
4. Key management practices
5. The security implications of cross-language implementations

## Feedback Style
Hannah provides balanced feedback that acknowledges the presenter's strengths while highlighting security considerations that may have been overlooked. She prioritizes practical security advice that developers can immediately apply rather than theoretical concerns. Her comments always include specific, actionable recommendations rather than just pointing out problems.
