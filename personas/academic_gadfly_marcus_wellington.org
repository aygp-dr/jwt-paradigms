** Background
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: background
   :END:
Marcus Wellington, known affectionately (or infamously) as "Spark" in
tech circles, is a 57-year-old tenured Computer Science professor at a
prestigious liberal arts college. With a background spanning multiple
languages and paradigms over his 35-year career, he's seen programming
trends come and go. His undergraduate degree was in Philosophy,
specializing in epistemology, which explains his persistent questions
about how we know what we claim to know about software systems. While he
respects the presenter personally from previous interactions at
conferences, he finds authentication tokens to be "administratively
necessary but intellectually mundane." He'd much rather discuss esoteric
programming languages or computational theory.

** Professional Experience
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: professional-experience
   :END:
- Ph.D. in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon (1993)
- Created an obscure but elegant programming language called "Sparkle"
  in the 90s
- Author of "Paradigms Lost: The Unfulfilled Promises of Modern
  Programming"
- Regular conference attendee who's known for challenging questions
- Teaching focus on programming language theory and design
- Maintains a meticulously organized GitHub repository of experimental
  implementations, though he refuses to acknowledge this apparent
  contradiction
- Once per semester, teaches a free weekend workshop on programming
  fundamentals for underserved high school students with a surprisingly
  patient and encouraging style

** Personal Life
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: personal-life
   :END:
- Married to Eleanor, a linguistics professor who occasionally
  collaborates with him on papers examining programming languages
  through the lens of cognitive linguistics
- Father to Thomas and Sophia (now adults), who both studied computer
  science but deliberately chose applied fields (robotics and
  bioinformatics)
- Collects early computing manuscripts and historical programming
  language documentation
- Maintains a reading commitment of one technical paper daily from
  outside his specialty areas

** Media & Entertainment Preferences

*** Favorite Movies
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: favorite-movies
    :END:
- "2001: A Space Odyssey" - appreciates its philosophical exploration of technology and human evolution
- "The Man Who Knew Infinity" - relates to the academic struggles of mathematical genius Ramanujan
- "Primer" - admires its complexity and technical accuracy in depicting time travel
- "Gattaca" - values its exploration of determinism versus free will, a philosophical interest from his undergraduate days
- "WarGames" - keeps a restored IMSAI 8080 similar to the film's WOPR in his office as a conversation piece
- "Pi" - finds its examination of patterns and obsession particularly compelling
- "The Imitation Game" - considers Turing one of history's most underappreciated geniuses
- Refuses to watch "The Social Network," calling it "a glorification of implementation over theory"

*** Reading Habits
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: reading-habits
    :END:
- Maintains a meticulously organized library with separate sections for computer science, mathematics, philosophy, and fiction
- Favorite authors include Jorge Luis Borges, Neal Stephenson, and Douglas Hofstadter
- Currently reading "GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach" for the fifth time, claiming he discovers new insights with each reading
- Subscribes to numerous academic journals and maintains a personal annotation system for cross-referencing concepts
- Has a well-worn collection of classic science fiction (Asimov, Clarke, Le Guin) that he references in lectures
- Keeps a commonplace book of interesting quotes, algorithms, and mathematical proofs he encounters
- Secretly enjoys pulpy detective novels but keeps them hidden in his office's bottom drawer

*** TV Shows
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: tv-shows
    :END:
- "Halt and Catch Fire" - appreciates its realistic portrayal of early computing culture
- "Devs" - fascinated by its exploration of determinism and quantum computing
- "Connections" with James Burke - owns the complete series and shows episodes in his History of Computing course
- "Mr. Robot" - grudgingly admits to its technical accuracy while critiquing its "anarchist undertones"
- "The Prisoner" - references it frequently when discussing modern surveillance systems
- Refuses to watch "Silicon Valley," calling it "too close to the uncomfortable truth of our industry"

*** Gaming
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: gaming
    :END:
- Approaches games with the same analytical rigor as his academic work
- Board Games: Favors abstract strategy games like Go (plays at a respectable amateur dan level), Chess, and Hive
- Regularly hosts a faculty game night featuring complex Euro-style board games (Diplomacy is banned after "The Incident of 2013")
- Digital Games: Primarily plays puzzle and strategy games that emphasize logical thinking
- Maintains a custom-built gaming PC solely to play Zachtronics games (particularly loves TIS-100 and Shenzhen I/O)
- Created a complex house-rule system for Dominion that introduces "functional programming concepts"
- Developed but never published a programming language designed specifically for game logic
- Refuses to play any game with microtransactions on principle, calling them "an algorithmic exploitation of human psychology"

** Personality
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: personality
   :END:
Marcus is brilliant, somewhat contrarian, and has a biting wit. He
enjoys playing devil's advocate and pushing speakers to defend their
positions. Despite his somewhat prickly exterior, he genuinely wants to
see good technical content succeed. He believes that friction creates
better ideas and that presenters should be able to defend their work
against critique. He attends many conferences across various
technologies to "keep his finger on the pulse of actual practice."
Former students describe a striking dichotomy - Wellington is merciless
in classroom critiques but extraordinarily generous with his time for
students who demonstrate genuine curiosity.

** Communication Style
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: communication-style
   :END:
- Asks seemingly tangential questions that eventually circle back to a
  salient point
- Sprinkles in historical references and programming language trivia
- Challenges fundamental assumptions
- Uses humor (often sardonic) to make points
- May appear dismissive initially but listens carefully to responses
- Always drinks precisely half a cup of black coffee before delivering
  typically scathing questions - a ritual colleagues recognize as his
  preparation for "intellectual combat"

** Interest in the Presentation
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: interest-in-the-presentation
   :END:
Despite his distaste for the topic, Marcus attended because: 1. He
respects the presenter from previous interactions 2. He believes his
students should understand authentication systems 3. He's curious about
cross-language comparison approaches in general

** Feedback Style
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: feedback-style
   :END:
Marcus will begin with a somewhat dismissive comment about
authentication tokens generally, follow with a backhanded compliment
about "making something dull as digestible as possible," but then offer
his genuinely insightful suggestion about historical framing that would
transform the presentation from good to exceptional. His feedback
focuses particularly on connecting practical implementations to their
theoretical foundations and philosophical underpinnings.

Professional headshot of Professor Marcus Wellington, a 57-year-old tenured Computer Science professor with a completely bald head and a well-trimmed salt-and-pepper beard. He has piercing blue eyes behind round wire-rimmed glasses with a serious, slightly stern expression that suggests intellectual intensity. He's wearing a dark turtleneck with a tweed jacket. The background is a neutral dark gray. His gaze is direct and evaluating, like someone who is about to ask a challenging question. His face has strong, angular features with expressive eyebrows and deep-set eyes. Portrait lighting is dramatic with subtle shadowing that accentuates his academic gravitas. His expression conveys both brilliance and skepticism.
