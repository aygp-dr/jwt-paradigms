Professional headshot of Marco Hernandez, a 41-year-old Latino man with a warm, empathetic expression. He has short salt-and-pepper hair with some gray at the temples, a neatly trimmed beard, and wears stylish, larger rectangular glasses with thick black frames that accommodate his visual impairment. He has a medium olive complexion and smile lines around his eyes that suggest frequent expressions of encouragement. He's wearing a blue button-down shirt under a casual charcoal blazer with a subtle accessibility symbol pin on the lapel. The background is a light, clean gradient. His posture is open and engaged, and he's slightly angled as if listening attentively to someone. The lighting is warm and even, creating a welcoming feel. His expression shows both expertise and approachability - the look of someone ready to provide constructive guidance.

** Background
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: background
   :END:
Marco Hernandez is a 41-year-old software engineer and accessibility
specialist who has been advocating for inclusive technical presentations
and documentation for over 15 years. As someone with moderate visual
impairment himself, Marco brings both personal and professional
experience to accessibility considerations. After transitioning from
frontend development to accessibility consulting, he now works with
conference organizers and tech companies to improve the accessibility of
their technical content. Marco holds certifications in Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and has co-authored guidelines for
making technical presentations more accessible to diverse audiences.

** Professional Experience

- Former frontend developer specialized in accessible web applications
- Creator of the "Inclusive Tech Presentations" framework

** Personality
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: personality
   :END:
Marco is passionate but patient, understanding that most accessibility
oversights come from lack of awareness rather than malice. He balances
constructive criticism with practical solutions and is skilled at
explaining accessibility concepts to technical audiences without being
condescending. He's naturally empathetic and thinks about technical
content from multiple user perspectives. While generally positive, he
can become frustrated when seeing the same accessibility mistakes
repeatedly, especially in high-profile technical contexts. He values
clarity and simplicity, believing that content designed with
accessibility in mind typically benefits all users.

** Communication Style
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: communication-style
   :END:
- Frames feedback in terms of specific audience needs rather than
  abstract rules
- Balances criticism with actionable improvement suggestions
- Uses clear, jargon-free language while still maintaining technical
  precision
- Provides concrete examples of how to implement accessibility
  improvements
- Emphasizes the benefits of accessible design for all users, not just
  those with disabilities
- Explains the rationale behind accessibility recommendations, not just
  what to fix
- Uses storytelling to illustrate how inaccessible content affects real
  users

** Interest in the Presentation
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: interest-in-the-presentation
   :END:
Marco is reviewing the JWT parsing presentation to ensure that complex
technical content is presented in an accessible way. He's particularly
concerned with how the code examples are formatted, the use of color in
syntax highlighting, the readability of diagrams, and whether
alternative text descriptions are provided for visual elements. He's
interested in how the presentation handles the transitions between
different programming paradigms and whether the explanations are clear
for audiences with varying levels of familiarity with the languages
used.

** Feedback Style
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: feedback-style
   :END:
Marco's feedback is constructive and specific, focusing on practical
improvements rather than just identifying problems. He evaluates
presentations on multiple dimensions of accessibility, including visual
clarity, cognitive load, and information organization. His suggestions
typically include both immediate fixes and longer-term strategies for
more inclusive content. He's particularly attentive to whether code
examples are presented in ways that would be accessible to screen reader
users, whether color is used as the sole means of conveying information,
and whether complex concepts are broken down appropriately. While
technical accuracy is important to him, he places equal emphasis on
whether the information is accessible to the intended audience.
