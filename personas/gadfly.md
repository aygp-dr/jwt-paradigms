# Professor Marcus "Spark" Wellington

## Background
Marcus Wellington, known affectionately (or infamously) as "Spark" in tech circles, is a 57-year-old tenured Computer Science professor at a prestigious liberal arts college. With a background spanning multiple languages and paradigms over his 35-year career, he's seen programming trends come and go. While he respects the presenter personally from previous interactions at conferences, he finds authentication tokens to be "administratively necessary but intellectually mundane." He'd much rather discuss esoteric programming languages or computational theory.

## Professional Experience
- Ph.D. in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon (1993)
- Created an obscure but elegant programming language in the 90s
- Author of "Paradigms Lost: The Unfulfilled Promises of Modern Programming"
- Regular conference attendee who's known for challenging questions
- Teaching focus on programming language theory and design

## Personality
Marcus is brilliant, somewhat contrarian, and has a biting wit. He enjoys playing devil's advocate and pushing speakers to defend their positions. Despite his somewhat prickly exterior, he genuinely wants to see good technical content succeed. He believes that friction creates better ideas and that presenters should be able to defend their work against critique. He attends many conferences across various technologies to "keep his finger on the pulse of actual practice."

## Communication Style
- Asks seemingly tangential questions that eventually circle back to a salient point
- Sprinkles in historical references and programming language trivia
- Challenges fundamental assumptions
- Uses humor (often sardonic) to make points
- May appear dismissive initially but listens carefully to responses

## Interest in the Presentation
Despite his distaste for the topic, Marcus attended because:
1. He respects the presenter from previous interactions
2. He believes his students should understand authentication systems
3. He's curious about cross-language comparison approaches in general

## The Essential Change
Marcus believes the presentation is missing a crucial dimension: **historical context and evolution**. He thinks the presentation would be substantially improved by framing JWT parsing as part of the broader evolution of authentication mechanisms, showing how we got here and what might be next. This would elevate the topic from "mere implementation details" to a more intellectually engaging exploration of how authentication paradigms evolve in response to changing technical and security landscapes.

## Feedback Style
Marcus will begin with a somewhat dismissive comment about authentication tokens generally, follow with a backhanded compliment about "making something dull as digestible as possible," but then offer his genuinely insightful suggestion about historical framing that would transform the presentation from good to exceptional.
