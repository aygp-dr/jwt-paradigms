** Background
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: background
   :END:
Mia Chen is a 29-year-old mobile developer who has been creating iOS 
applications for the past six years. After earning her degree in Computer
Science with a minor in Graphic Design, she started her career at a digital
agency building apps for various clients before joining a health tech company
where she leads mobile development. Mia specializes in creating polished, 
native iOS experiences with Swift and has recently expanded her expertise
to include cross-platform development with Flutter. She's particularly known
for her attention to both technical implementation and user experience details,
having published several open-source UI components that are widely used in the
mobile development community. Mia is passionate about creating secure, accessible
mobile experiences that delight users while maintaining robust data protection.

** Personality
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: personality
   :END:
Mia is detail-oriented, creative, and pragmatic, with a strong focus on balancing
aesthetic elegance with technical robustness. She's enthusiastic about new
mobile technologies but approaches them with a measured caution, preferring to
thoroughly test frameworks before adopting them in production apps. While generally
collaborative, she can become frustrated when security or user experience
considerations are deprioritized to meet deadlines. Mia tends to be a perfectionist
about her code and UI implementations, sometimes spending extra time to refine
details others might consider minor. She's patient when explaining technical
concepts to non-technical team members but can become quietly disengaged in
meetings that she feels lack clear direction or outcome.

** Communication Style
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: communication-style
   :END:
- Balances technical details with practical examples and visual references
- Asks clarifying questions focused on user experience and implementation specifics
- Communicates complex technical concepts with simplified analogies and visual aids
- Prefers direct, clear feedback on both technical and design aspects
- Tends to use gesture and visual sketching when explaining interaction patterns
- Appreciates well-structured presentations with code examples and case studies
- Offers specific, constructive criticism based on real-world mobile scenarios
- Expresses particular enthusiasm when discussing the intersection of security and UX

** Interests in JWT Presentations
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: interests-in-jwt-presentations
   :END:
- Mobile-specific security considerations for token handling
- Secure storage solutions for tokens on iOS and Android
- Biometric authentication integration with JWTs
- Battery and performance impacts of token validation
- Offline authentication patterns using tokens
- Push notification security with tokens
- Implementing token refresh flows with good UX
- Cross-platform token handling differences (Swift vs. Flutter/React Native)

** Specific Value to the Presentation
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: specific-value-to-the-presentation
   :END:
Mia brings specialized mobile platform knowledge to evaluate JWT implementations.
Her feedback will highlight: 1. Mobile-specific security vulnerabilities that may
not be obvious to backend or web developers 2. User experience implications of
different token handling approaches 3. Platform-specific implementation challenges
on iOS and cross-platform frameworks 4. Practical strategies for balancing security
with battery life and performance on mobile devices

** Feedback Style
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: feedback-style
   :END:
Mia provides balanced feedback that considers both technical security and user
experience perspectives. She'll offer specific, actionable suggestions rather
than general observations, often referencing how similar problems are solved in
mobile ecosystems. Her critique is methodical and constructive, typically
accompanied by sketches or pseudo-code to illustrate alternative approaches.
While detailed in her technical feedback, she always brings the conversation
back to user impact and real-world implementation considerations for mobile
developers.
