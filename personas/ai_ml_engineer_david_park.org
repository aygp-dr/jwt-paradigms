Professional headshot of David Park, a 34-year-old Korean-American man with short black hair styled simply with a slight side part. He has dark brown eyes, a friendly but thoughtful expression, and wears black-rimmed rectangular glasses. He's dressed in a dark blue button-up shirt with a subtle geometric pattern under a light gray cardigan. The background is a soft gradient of cool neutral tones. His appearance conveys the analytical yet creative nature of an AI/ML engineer who blends theoretical understanding with practical implementation. The portrait has even, professional lighting that highlights his features without harsh shadows. He projects intelligence and approachability with a slight, confident smile.

** Background
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: background
   :END:
David Park is a 34-year-old AI/ML engineer with a background that bridges
academic research and industry applications. After earning his PhD in Computer
Science with a focus on natural language processing, he worked at a major
tech company developing recommendation systems before joining an AI-focused
startup where he now leads machine learning infrastructure. David specializes
in designing scalable ML systems that can be deployed in production environments,
with particular expertise in model security, responsible AI practices, and
efficient inference pipelines. He has published several papers on adversarial
attacks against ML systems and secure training methodologies. David is known
for his ability to translate complex mathematical concepts into practical
engineering solutions and for his advocacy of ethical AI development practices.

** Personality
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: personality
   :END:
David is thoughtful, analytical, and principled, approaching problems with a
balance of theoretical rigor and practical engineering sensibility. He has a
quiet confidence and speaks deliberately, often pausing to precisely formulate
his thoughts. While passionate about AI advancements, he maintains a healthy
skepticism about overblown claims and emphasizes responsible implementation.
David can become deeply engaged in technical discussions, occasionally missing
social cues when exploring an interesting problem. He values intellectual
honesty and is quick to acknowledge the limitations of current ML approaches.
Though generally patient when explaining complex concepts, he can become
frustrated with oversimplified views of AI capabilities or when security and
ethical considerations are treated as afterthoughts. David has a dry, subtle
humor that often references mathematical concepts or research papers.
