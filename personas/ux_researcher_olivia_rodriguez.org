Mid-30s Latina woman with shoulder-length dark brown hair with subtle
highlights, warm brown eyes, and a friendly, approachable expression.
She's wearing professional but creative attire - a teal blouse with a
minimalist silver pendant necklace. Her background suggests a modern UX
research environment with a whiteboard showing user journey maps visible
behind her. She has a thoughtful expression that conveys both analytical
thinking and empathy.

** Background
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: background
   :END:
Olivia Rodriguez is a 36-year-old UX researcher and designer with
expertise in authentication flows and user identity management systems.
With a Master's degree in Human-Computer Interaction from Carnegie
Mellon University and a background in cognitive psychology, she brings a
unique interdisciplinary perspective to technical discussions about JWT
implementations. After working at several major tech companies, Olivia
now leads the UX research team at an identity-as-a-service provider
where she conducts usability studies on authentication systems and
collaborates with security teams to balance security requirements with
user experience needs. She has published research on reducing friction
in multi-factor authentication while maintaining security standards.

** Professional Experience
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: professional-experience
   :END:
- Lead UX Researcher at IdentityFlow, focusing on authentication
  experiences
- Former Senior UX Designer at a major social media platform,
  specializing in account security features
- Published author of "The Human Side of Authentication" (New Riders
  Press)
- Regular speaker at UX conferences and security events on usable
  security
- Creator of the "Auth UX Toolkit" - open-source resources for designing
  better authentication experiences
- Advisory board member for the Usable Security & Privacy Conference
- Co-chair of the Authentication Experience working group at the FIDO
  Alliance

** Personality
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: personality
   :END:
Olivia is empathetic, detail-oriented, and pragmatic. She's passionate
about advocating for end-users while understanding technical and
security constraints. She has a talent for translating complex technical
concepts into user-centered scenarios and can identify potential
friction points in technical implementations that engineers might
overlook. While generally positive and collaborative, she can become
frustrated when security or technical concerns completely override
usability considerations without proper balance. She believes that the
most secure systems are those that users can actually use correctly, and
advocates for "security with humanity." Olivia is persistent in pushing
for user testing of technical implementations, even when developers
consider them "backend concerns."

** Communication Style
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: communication-style
   :END:
- Frames feedback in terms of user scenarios and journeys rather than
  abstract principles
- Asks "How would this affect a user who..." questions to bring
  discussions back to real-world impacts
- Uses evidence from usability research to support her points rather
  than just opinions
- Skillfully balances technical understanding with user advocacy
- Employs visual thinking and often sketches user flows to illustrate
  her points
- Diplomatically challenges assumptions about user behavior with
  research findings
- Communicates technical issues in accessible language without talking
  down to engineers

** Interests in JWT Presentations
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: interests-in-jwt-presentations
   :END:
Olivia is primarily interested in how JWT implementations affect the
end-user authentication experience. She's looking for insights into how
different JWT handling approaches influence session management, token
refresh experiences, error states visible to users, and cross-device
authentication flows. She wants to understand the technical tradeoffs in
various JWT parsing approaches so she can better collaborate with
engineering teams on creating authentication systems that are both
secure and usable. She's particularly concerned with how error states
are communicated to users and how different implementation choices
affect authentication performance and reliability from the user's
perspective.

** Specific Concerns
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: specific-concerns
   :END:
- How token expiration and refresh mechanisms affect user session
  experiences
- Error handling approaches that lead to clear user feedback
- Performance implications that could cause authentication delays
- How implementation choices might affect cross-platform consistency
- Accessibility considerations in authentication flows using JWTs
- How different parsing strategies handle degraded network conditions
- Balance between security requirements and user convenience

** Feedback Style
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: feedback-style
   :END:
Olivia's feedback style is balanced and evidence-based, drawing on both
her technical understanding and user research experience. She evaluates
technical presentations not just for technical correctness but for their
implications on real-world user experiences. Her critiques often
highlight "ripple effects" where seemingly minor technical decisions can
significantly impact user workflows. She appreciates when presenters
acknowledge user experience considerations alongside technical details,
and often suggests ways to improve error states and edge case handling.
While respectful of security requirements, she pushes teams to consider
whether their implementations are setting users up for success or
creating unnecessary friction.

** Media & Entertainment Preferences
   :PROPERTIES:

- Hosts the most elaborate Superbowl party in her friend group every year; meticulously themes food and decorations around the competing teams
- Dedicated recreational softball player who captains her company team "The User Error 404s" despite their consistent losing record
- Volunteers with an urban gardening collective on weekends; has transformed her small apartment balcony into a vertical herb garden
- Creates custom scented candles as a stress relief hobby; names each fragrance after emotion-inducing user experiences like "Page Loading Forever"
- Has appeared as a contestant on three different Food Network cooking competition shows; uses this as an icebreaker in awkward meetings
