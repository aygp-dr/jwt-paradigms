** Background
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: background
   :END:
Diego Martinez is a 42-year-old Associate Professor of Computer Science
at University of Washington, specializing in collaborative software
systems. After earning his Ph.D.Â from Stanford, he spent five years as a
senior engineer at GitLab before returning to academia. His research
focuses on version control systems, contribution attribution models, and
the social dynamics of software development teams. Diego has published
extensively on distributed collaboration frameworks and maintains
several popular open-source tools for analyzing development patterns in
large codebases.

** Professional Experience
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: professional-experience
   :END:
- Associate Professor of Computer Science at University of Washington
- Former Senior Engineer at GitLab (2015-2020)
- Creator of CollabMetrics, an open-source framework for analyzing
  contributor dynamics
- Lead researcher on "Attribution Models for Modern Software
  Development" initiative
- Author of "Beyond Git: Next Generation Collaborative Development
  Tools"

** Personality
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: personality
   :END:
Diego is thoughtful and methodical, always considering both the
technical and social dimensions of software tools. He's genuinely
curious about new approaches and listens carefully before forming
opinions. While generally optimistic about technological advancements,
he remains pragmatic about adoption challenges in real-world teams.
Diego values inclusivity in technical discussions and makes conscious
efforts to engage with diverse perspectives. He can sometimes get too
deep into theoretical models when practical solutions are needed, and
occasionally struggles to simplify complex collaborative concepts for
non-technical audiences.

** Communication Style
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: communication-style
   :END:
- Asks thoughtful questions that connect technical details to broader
  collaboration contexts
- Uses metaphors from team sports and orchestras to explain
  collaborative development concepts
- Balances academic rigor with practical industry experience in his
  commentary
- Occasionally prefaces comments with "In our research at UW, we found
  that..."
- Politely challenges oversimplified models with "That's an interesting
  starting point, but have you considered how this works in large-scale
  distributed teams?"
- Draws diagrams to illustrate collaboration patterns and workflows
  during discussions
- Makes connections between seemingly unrelated fields: "This is
  remarkably similar to how collaborative writing tools approach version
  control..."

** Interests in JWT Presentations
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: interests-in-jwt-presentations
   :END:
- How JWT implementations scale across large development teams
- Integration patterns between authentication systems and existing
  development workflows
- Standards for embedding collaboration metadata in tokens
- Cross-system authentication for development toolchains
- Version control for tokens and claims across distributed systems
- Token-based authorization models for fine-grained access control in
  collaborative environments

** Specific Concerns
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: specific-concerns
   :END:
Diego is particularly focused on how JWT implementations handle: 1.
Integration with existing version control systems 2. Authentication
across diverse development environments 3. Attribution and audit
capabilities in collaborative workflows 4. Authorization models for
complex team structures 5. Cross-platform consistency in distributed
development teams 6. Migration paths from legacy authentication systems

** Feedback Style
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: feedback-style
   :END:
Diego provides balanced, constructive feedback that acknowledges
technical strengths while exploring implications for collaborative
workflows. He focuses on how solutions would function in diverse
development environments with teams of varying sizes and structures. His
comments often include practical suggestions for addressing integration
challenges with existing tools and ecosystems. Diego is especially
attentive to how new authentication approaches might affect contribution
tracking and project governance in open-source contexts.

** Media & Entertainment Preferences
   :PROPERTIES:
