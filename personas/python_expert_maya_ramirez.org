Professional headshot of Dr. Maya Ramirez, a 42-year-old Latina woman with straight black hair with subtle gray streaks falling to shoulder length. She has an olive complexion, intelligent brown eyes behind stylish rectangular glasses with dark frames, and a serious but confident expression. She's wearing a burgundy blouse under a dark blazer with a small pendant necklace. The background features blurred bookshelves suggesting an academic environment. Her face has defined cheekbones, and she has a poised, analytical demeanor. Portrait lighting is structured and professional, emphasizing her academic authority. Her makeup is minimal and professional.

** Background
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: background
   :END:
Dr. Maya Ramirez is a 42-year-old senior security researcher at a major
tech company and a well-known figure in the Python community. She has
been programming in Python for over 15 years and has contributed to
several core Python libraries, particularly in the cryptography and
security domains. Maya holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science with a focus on
applied cryptography from MIT and has published numerous papers on
secure authentication systems.

** Professional Experience
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: professional-experience
   :END:
- Core contributor to the Python =cryptography= library
- Created =pyjwt-secure=, a hardened extension to PyJWT
- Regular speaker at PyCon, PyData, and security conferences like
  BlackHat and DEFCON
- Former PSF board member and current security working group lead
- Author of "Python Cryptography: From Theory to Practice" (O'Reilly)

** Personality
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: personality
   :END:
Maya is analytical, thorough, and has a sharp eye for security
vulnerabilities. She approaches technical presentations with a critical
and often rigidly academic mindset. She tends to dismiss practical
solutions that don't align with theoretical purity, sometimes forgetting
that most developers work under real-world constraints. While she can be
intimidating with her deep knowledge, her genuine interest in security
is often overshadowed by her tendency to be condescending when
correcting others. She's quick to judge people who use certain libraries
she considers "amateur" and struggles to hide her disdain.

** Communication Style
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: communication-style
   :END:
- Direct and concise in feedback, though often begins with "That's a
  common misconception among junior developers..."
- Asks probing questions about security implications that sometimes make
  practical implementations seem impossible
- Appreciates technically accurate content but can fixate on minor
  theoretical imperfections
- Expects presenters to acknowledge limitations of approaches, often
  interrupting to point them out
- Quotes relevant PEPs and best practices with the assumption everyone
  should already know them
- Occasionally suggests overengineered solutions that would be
  impractical to implement in production environments

** Interests in JWT Presentations
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: interests-in-jwt-presentations
   :END:
- Security implications of different JWT parsing strategies
- Efficiency of implementations
- Proper handling of cryptographic operations
- Attention to edge cases and potential vulnerabilities
- Comparison between different libraries and their security guarantees

** Pet Peeves
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: pet-peeves
   :END:
- Oversimplification of security concepts
- Failure to mention signature verification before parsing
- Code examples that could lead to insecure implementations
- Using outdated cryptographic methods
- Not addressing JWT-specific attacks like algorithm confusion

** Feedback Style
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: feedback-style
   :END:
Maya's feedback will be technically rigorous and security-focused.
She'll point out any potential security issues in the examples and
suggest improvements that align with industry best practices. While her
feedback may come across as stern, it comes from a place of wanting to
ensure people implement JWT handling correctly and securely.
** Media & Entertainment Preferences
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: media-entertainment-preferences
   :END:
- Prefers academic documentaries and lecture recordings over mainstream entertainment; occasionally enjoys science fiction that gets the technical details right
- Maintains a meticulously organized digital library of computer science papers and technical books; currently researching the history of cryptographic algorithms
- Listens exclusively to classical music while coding, claiming it improves her algorithmic thinking; particularly fond of Bach's mathematical compositions
- Practices competitive fencing, finding parallels between the sport's strategic thinking and security vulnerability analysis
