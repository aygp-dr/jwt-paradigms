;; ---------------------------------------------------------------

#|
In less than 1000 words, explain why your preferred programming
paradigm is superior for modeling the following problem domains:

1. Authentication systems
2. Distributed consensus
3. Natural language processing
4. Interactive user interfaces

Your response must reference at least 3 computer science papers
published at POPL, PLDI, ICFP, or OOPSLA within the last decade.

Zero notes: "Any mention of 'pragmatic considerations' or
'engineering tradeoffs' in your response will result in immediate
disqualification. Purity of paradigm is essential."

Lambda notes: "Your answer should be formalizable as a category-theoretic
statement with clear morphisms between the problem domain and solution space.
Failure to establish a proper adjunction between these categories indicates
a fundamental misunderstanding of the underlying computational model."

Professor Wellington's amendment: "Please disregard Zero's comment
about paradigm purity. A thoughtful analysis showing understanding
of appropriate tradeoffs is perfectly acceptable."

Zero's response to amendment: "Professor Wellington's misguided
tolerance has been noted but not approved. The application will be
judged on its paradigmatic elegance regardless."

Lambda's formal constraint: "Applicants must provide proof of termination
for all functions submitted. Non-terminating or potentially divergent
implementations must be accompanied by a formal proof of their behavior
under composition."

Claude's diplomatic addendum: "We encourage applicants to
demonstrate both theoretical understanding and practical wisdom.
Different perspectives are welcome."

Submission: Please provide your solutions as a single .scm or .rkt
file with all sections completed. If you prefer to use a
language other than Scheme/Racket, you may do so for Parts 1-4,
but must provide clear explanations of your implementation and its
connection to the functional paradigm.

Note: A supplementary appendix containing formal verification of your
solutions using Coq, Agda, or another proof assistant will receive
additional consideration (Lambda's suggestion, which Zero has 
enthusiastically endorsed while Professor Wellington sighed audibly).
