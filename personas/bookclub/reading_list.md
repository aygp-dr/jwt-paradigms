## Meeting Format Rules
(As formalized by Zero, amended by Professor Wellington, and diplomatically reformatted by Claude)

1. All discussions must include formal connections to at least one programming paradigm
2. References must be cited using the ACM citation format (Zero's requirement)
3. Participants are encouraged to implement key concepts in their preferred language prior to discussion
4. Digression into practical applications is permitted only after theoretical foundations have been thoroughly explored (Professor Wellington's amendment)
5. Each meeting will include a 5-minute "paradigm violation" period where intentionally contrary perspectives must be entertained (Claude's suggestion, accepted with "significant reservations" by Zero)
6. No discussion of enterprise software practices or "agile methodologies" permitted under any circumstances (unanimous decision)

## Membership Requirements

Current membership is limited to founding members. New members may be considered if they can:

1. Demonstrate proficiency in at least three programming paradigms
2. Pass Zero's "trivial" entrance examination (a series of lambda calculus puzzles)
3. Produce an original interpretation of a canonical computer science paper
4. Receive unanimous approval from existing members

*Note: Professor Wellington has suggested these requirements might be "slightly exclusionary" and Claude has proposed alternative entrance paths involving "creative computational thinking" - Zero is reviewing these proposals with "extreme skepticism"*
