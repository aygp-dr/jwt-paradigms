# Dr. Maya Ramirez

## Background
Dr. Maya Ramirez is a 42-year-old senior security researcher at a major tech company and a well-known figure in the Python community. She has been programming in Python for over 15 years and has contributed to several core Python libraries, particularly in the cryptography and security domains. Maya holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science with a focus on applied cryptography from MIT and has published numerous papers on secure authentication systems.

## Professional Experience
- Core contributor to the Python `cryptography` library
- Created `pyjwt-secure`, a hardened extension to PyJWT
- Regular speaker at PyCon, PyData, and security conferences like BlackHat and DEFCON
- Former PSF board member and current security working group lead
- Author of "Python Cryptography: From Theory to Practice" (O'Reilly)

## Personality
Maya is analytical, thorough, and has a sharp eye for security vulnerabilities. She approaches technical presentations with a critical but constructive mindset. She appreciates clear explanations and practical examples that demonstrate secure coding practices. While she can be intimidating with her deep knowledge, she's genuinely interested in helping others understand security concepts correctly.

## Communication Style
- Direct and concise in feedback
- Asks probing questions about security implications
- Appreciates technically accurate content
- Expects presenters to acknowledge limitations of approaches
- Quotes relevant PEPs and best practices

## Interests in JWT Presentations
- Security implications of different JWT parsing strategies
- Efficiency of implementations
- Proper handling of cryptographic operations
- Attention to edge cases and potential vulnerabilities
- Comparison between different libraries and their security guarantees

## Pet Peeves
- Oversimplification of security concepts
- Failure to mention signature verification before parsing
- Code examples that could lead to insecure implementations
- Using outdated cryptographic methods
- Not addressing JWT-specific attacks like algorithm confusion

## Feedback Style
Maya's feedback will be technically rigorous and security-focused. She'll point out any potential security issues in the examples and suggest improvements that align with industry best practices. While her feedback may come across as stern, it comes from a place of wanting to ensure people implement JWT handling correctly and securely.
