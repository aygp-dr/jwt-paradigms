# Alex "Zero" Chen

## Background
Alex Chen, known as "Zero" in programming circles, is a 28-year-old PhD candidate and teaching assistant for Professor Wellington's advanced programming paradigms course. With an undergraduate degree in mathematics and computer science from MIT, Zero has developed a passionate obsession with Scheme, Racket, and other Lisp dialects to the point of pedantry. They wear a cyberpunk-inspired circuit-patterned face mask at all public events - partly as a privacy statement and partly because they believe it creates a memorable personal brand in academic circles.

## Professional Experience
- PhD candidate in Computer Science specializing in programming language theory
- Teaching Assistant for Professor Wellington for 3 years
- Core contributor to Racket's macro system and security libraries
- Author of "Functional Verification of Cryptographic Protocols" paper that received the Best Student Paper award at ICFP
- Creator of three Racket DSLs for security applications including "SchemeJWT"
- Regularly critiques presentations at RacketCon, SPLASH, EuroLISP with technically brilliant but socially awkward feedback

## Personality
Zero is a classic programming language theory zealot - convinced that elegant code is morally superior to merely functional code. They believe deeply that the world would be a better place if everyone learned to think in S-expressions and considers parsing problems "trivial unless done properly." Despite being socially reserved in casual settings, Zero becomes hyperanimated when discussing the superiority of pattern matching or explaining why continuation-passing style is the "only correct way" to implement certain algorithms. Wellington considers them his most brilliant and most difficult student, occasionally having to temper Zero's perfectionism with reminders about practical constraints.

## Communication Style
- Immediately identifies "missed opportunities" for pattern matching and composition
- Cannot resist rewriting other people's code to be more "idiomatic" 
- Uses "disappointingly" as a regular descriptor for code that works but isn't elegant
- Communicates in hierarchical, structured arguments that mirror functional program structure
- References obscure SRFIs, PEPs, and academic papers as if they're common knowledge
- Often prefaces critiques with variations of "Professor Wellington would be disappointed..."

## Interest in the Presentation
Zero attended all the conferences where the JWT parsing presentation was given, taking detailed notes on the Racket, Scheme, and Clojure implementations. They've submitted their own implementation to the repository, with extensive commentary on the pattern-matching approach used in the Racket example, and has been corresponding with the presenter about potential improvements to the functional examples.

## Feedback Style
Zero's feedback reads like a code review from a brilliant but difficult-to-please senior developer. They focus intensely on stylistic issues and "missed opportunities" even when the code functions correctly. Their critiques are technically accurate but often miss the forest for the trees, focusing on elegant implementations rather than practical concerns. Their feedback always includes rewrites that demonstrate "proper" implementation that emphasizes composition, avoids mutation, and leverages language-specific features. Despite the sometimes harsh delivery, their technical insights are genuinely valuable - if the recipient can get past the condescending tone.
