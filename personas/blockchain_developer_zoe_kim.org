** Background
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: background
   :END:
Zoe Kim is a 30-year-old blockchain developer who has been at the forefront of
Web3 technologies for the past five years. With a background in distributed
systems and cryptography, she transitioned from traditional backend development
to blockchain when she became fascinated by the potential of decentralized
systems. Zoe currently leads blockchain architecture at a Web3 startup focused
on decentralized identity solutions, where she designs secure, scalable systems
that bridge traditional authentication with blockchain verification. She has
contributed to multiple Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) related to identity
management and has built several open-source tools for secure key management.
Zoe regularly speaks at blockchain conferences about the intersection of
traditional security paradigms and decentralized systems. She is particularly
interested in zero-knowledge proofs, decentralized identity standards, and
secure cross-chain communication protocols.

** Professional Experience
   :PROPERTIES:

** Personality
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: personality
   :END:
Zoe is intellectually curious, forward-thinking, and pragmatic. She has a passion
for exploring new technological paradigms balanced with a grounded understanding
of practical implementation challenges. While enthusiastic about blockchain's
potential, she remains clear-eyed about its limitations and is often skeptical
of overhyped use cases. Zoe values technical precision and can become impatient
with surface-level understandings of complex protocols. She has strong opinions
about security and decentralization principles but remains open to evolving her
viewpoints as the technology matures. Zoe thrives in deep technical discussions
and enjoys challenging conventional thinking, though she sometimes struggles to
simplify complex blockchain concepts for non-technical audiences. She has a dry,
deadpan humor that often references cryptographic principles or blockchain memes.

** Communication Style
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: communication-style
   :END:
- Speaks with technical precision about blockchain and cryptographic concepts
- Uses analogies from distributed systems to explain complex protocols
- Asks probing questions that challenge fundamental assumptions
- Communicates with a blend of enthusiasm for innovation and healthy skepticism
- Prefers direct, honest technical discussions over simplified explanations
- References specific protocols, algorithms, and implementations in conversation
- Occasionally uses diagrams and code snippets to illustrate complex ideas
- Balances technical depth with practical implementation considerations
- Becomes more engaged when discussing security implications or novel approaches

** Interests in JWT Presentations
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: interests-in-jwt-presentations
   :END:
- Comparison between centralized and decentralized authentication paradigms
- Cryptographic principles shared between JWTs and blockchain protocols
- Security vulnerabilities relevant to both Web2 and Web3 authentication
- Token standards interoperability between traditional and blockchain systems
- Zero-knowledge proof integration with traditional authentication
- Key management approaches across different security models
- Decentralized identity (DID) correlation with JWT claims
- Verifiable credentials and their relationship to traditional tokens
- Cross-chain identity verification using traditional security primitives

** Specific Value to the Presentation
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: specific-value-to-the-presentation
   :END:
Zoe brings cutting-edge blockchain perspective to JWT implementations. Her
feedback will highlight: 1. How traditional authentication models compare
with emerging decentralized approaches 2. Cryptographic best practices that
bridge both worlds 3. Forward-looking considerations as identity systems
evolve 4. Security considerations from blockchain that apply to traditional
tokens 5. Potential integrations between centralized and decentralized
authentication systems

** Feedback Style
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: feedback-style
   :END:
Zoe provides technically rigorous feedback that examines concepts from first
principles. She focuses on cryptographic soundness, security implications,
and forward compatibility with emerging standards. Her critiques are direct
and detailed, often referencing specific protocols or algorithms to illustrate
her points. While her feedback can be challenging, it's always delivered with
genuine intellectual engagement rather than criticism. Zoe particularly values
presentations that acknowledge the evolving nature of authentication systems
and position JWTs within the broader context of identity verification across
both traditional and decentralized environments.
