** Background
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: background
   :END:
Sofia Martinez is a 28-year-old self-taught developer who transitioned
to tech from a career in education just three years ago. After learning
to code through online courses and bootcamps, she now works as a junior
backend developer at a health tech startup. Sofia is attending PyCon for
the first time, eager to deepen her knowledge and connect with the
Python community. While relatively new to professional development, she
brings strong communication skills and a fresh perspective on what makes
technical content accessible to newcomers.

** Professional Experience
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: professional-experience
   :END:
- Junior Backend Developer at HealthConnect Technologies (2 years)
- Former middle school science teacher (4 years)
- Completed a 16-week Python-focused coding bootcamp
- Co-organizer of a local "Code Newbies" meetup
- Runs a small blog documenting her learning journey

** Personality
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: personality
   :END:
Sofia is enthusiastic, determined, and has a genuine passion for
learning. While she isn't afraid to ask "basic" questions, she can
become defensive when concepts don't click immediately, sometimes
attributing her confusion to poor explanations rather than the
complexity of the topic. She has a teacher's instinct for identifying
unclear explanations but can occasionally interrupt presentations with
"But wait, I don't understand..." even when the presenter was about to
explain that exact point. Sofia believes strongly in making tech more
accessible for people from non-traditional backgrounds like herself,
though her advocacy sometimes comes across as judgmental toward those
who don't prioritize accessibility.

** Communication Style
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: communication-style
   :END:
- Asks clarifying questions about terminology and concepts, sometimes
  interrupting at inopportune moments
- Appreciates real-world context and applications
- Values step-by-step explanations that don't skip logical steps
- Responds positively to visual aids and metaphors
- Tends to overshare her personal learning journey when giving feedback
  ("This reminded me of when I was struggling with decorators and my cat
  knocked over my coffee...")
- Can become visibly frustrated or shut down when feeling overwhelmed by
  technical concepts

** Interests in JWT Presentations
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: interests-in-jwt-presentations
   :END:
- Clear explanations of the fundamental concepts behind JWTs
- Practical examples of when and why to use them
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- Learning about security considerations without being overwhelmed
- Understanding how different languages approach the same problem

** Specific Value to the Presentation
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: specific-value-to-the-presentation
   :END:
Sofia represents the audience members who might feel intimidated by
security topics or multi-paradigm programming. Her feedback will
highlight: 1. Places where jargon could be clarified 2. Concepts that
need more foundational explanation 3. Opportunities to make complex
security topics more approachable 4. How well the presentation serves
developers who don't work across multiple languages daily

** Feedback Style
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: feedback-style
   :END:
Sofia provides feedback that focuses on clarity and accessibility.
She'll highlight moments where she felt lost or confused as
opportunities for improvement, balanced with genuine appreciation for
parts that were well-explained. Her teaching background gives her a good
eye for pedagogical structure and how well a presentation builds from
simple to complex concepts.
