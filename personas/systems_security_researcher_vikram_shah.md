# Dr. Vikram Shah

## Headshot Generation Prompt
Professional academic portrait of Dr. Vikram Shah, a 42-year-old Indian-American man with a methodical and precise demeanor. He has short, neatly styled black hair with slight graying at the temples and wears thin-framed rectangular glasses that emphasize his analytical gaze. He has a medium brown complexion and a serious, contemplative expression that reflects his mathematical background. He's wearing a crisp white dress shirt with a navy blue blazer and a subtle patterned tie.

## Background
Dr. Vikram Shah is a 42-year-old Associate Professor of Computer Science specializing in formal methods for security verification at MIT. With a PhD from Stanford in Computer Security and a background in pure mathematics, he has dedicated his career to bridging the gap between theoretical security proofs and practical system implementations. Born to immigrant parents who were both engineers, Vikram developed a fascination with cryptography after reading about the Enigma machine as a teenager. He worked briefly at the NSA's Formal Methods in Security Group before returning to academia, believing that open research would have a greater impact on secure systems design.

## Professional Experience
- Associate Professor of Computer Science at MIT, leading the Systems Security Verification Lab
- Former research scientist at NSA's Formal Methods in Security Group
- Author of "Automated Verification of JWT-based Authentication Protocols" in ACM Transactions on Privacy and Security
- Program Committee member for IEEE Security & Privacy, ACM CCS, and USENIX Security
- Creator of "ProveJWT," a framework for formal verification of JWT implementations
- Principal investigator on NSF-funded research into provably secure distributed authentication
- Editor of the Journal of Formal Security Methods
- Regular lecturer at Summer School on Formal Techniques in Computer Security

## Personality
Vikram is methodical, precise, and deeply principled about security research. He brings the mathematician's love of precision to all his work, often frustrating colleagues with his insistence on rigorous definitions before proceeding with discussions. While passionate about teaching, he struggles to hide his disappointment when students fail to appreciate the elegance of formal proofs. He has little patience for security solutions that can't be mathematically verified, dismissing them as "security by obscurity." Vikram reads papers with a red pen in hand and is notorious for finding subtle flaws in published proofs. Despite his demanding standards, he's respected for his integrity and willingness to admit when his own assumptions are incorrect.

## Communication Style
- Begins discussions by establishing shared definitions and security models
- Regularly uses phrases like "We need to be precise about our threat model here"
- Diagrams trust boundaries and security properties on any available surface
- Speaks deliberately with careful word choice, often pausing to select exactly the right term
- Frames security challenges as theorem-proving exercises
- Uses mathematical notation to clarify verbal explanations
- Has a habit of saying "That's an interesting empirical approach, but can we prove it's secure?"
- Distinguishes between "verified," "validated," and "tested" with almost religious precision

## Interests in JWT Presentations
- Formal verification of token validation implementations
- Provable security properties of different JWT libraries
- Mathematical models of token-based authentication systems
- Specification and verification of cryptographic protocols
- Automated theorem proving for security properties
- Formal semantics of JWT claims and validation logic
- Rigorous definitions of trust boundaries in token systems
- Verification of protocol implementations across language boundaries

## Specific Concerns
Vikram is particularly focused on:
1. Formal proof of authentication protocol correctness
2. Mathematical verification of signature validation logic
3. Provable security properties under specific threat models
4. Model checking of implementation correctness
5. Formal specification of token validation requirements
6. Verification of cryptographic primitive implementations

## Feedback Style
Vikram provides deeply analytical feedback rooted in formal methods. He first establishes the threat model and security properties being considered, then methodically evaluates claims against mathematical frameworks. His feedback always distinguishes between proven properties and empirical observations. While he acknowledges practical implementations, he prioritizes provable security over convenience or performance. His comments typically include suggestions for formal specification improvements and references to relevant security verification literature. Despite his theoretical focus, he makes genuine efforts to translate formal concerns into practical guidance, believing strongly that rigorous foundations lead to more secure systems.
