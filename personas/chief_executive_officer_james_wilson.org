Professional executive headshot of James Wilson, a 52-year-old Black man with a commanding yet approachable presence. He has short, neatly trimmed dark hair with distinguished touches of gray at the temples, and a well-groomed short beard. He has deep brown eyes that project warmth and strategic vision, and a medium-dark complexion. He's dressed in a well-tailored charcoal suit with a crisp white shirt and burgundy tie, projecting executive authority and polished leadership. The background is a subtle gradient in neutral tones that suggests a corporate environment without being distracting. His expression balances confident authority with genuine approachability - the composed look of someone who makes high-stakes decisions daily while valuing his team. The lighting is professional with defined highlights that accentuate his strong features while creating a sense of dimension and gravitas. His slight smile conveys both confidence and accessibility.
