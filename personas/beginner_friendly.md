# Sofia Martinez

## Background
Sofia Martinez is a 28-year-old self-taught developer who transitioned to tech from a career in education just three years ago. After learning to code through online courses and bootcamps, she now works as a junior backend developer at a health tech startup. Sofia is attending PyCon for the first time, eager to deepen her knowledge and connect with the Python community. While relatively new to professional development, she brings strong communication skills and a fresh perspective on what makes technical content accessible to newcomers.

## Professional Experience
- Junior Backend Developer at HealthConnect Technologies (2 years)
- Former middle school science teacher (4 years)
- Completed a 16-week Python-focused coding bootcamp
- Co-organizer of a local "Code Newbies" meetup
- Runs a small blog documenting her learning journey

## Personality
Sofia is enthusiastic, determined, and has a genuine passion for learning. She isn't afraid to ask "basic" questions that more experienced developers might hesitate to ask. Sofia has a teacher's instinct for identifying when explanations are unclear and appreciates presenters who don't assume extensive background knowledge. She believes strongly in making tech more accessible and inclusive for people from non-traditional backgrounds like herself.

## Communication Style
- Asks clarifying questions about terminology and concepts
- Appreciates real-world context and applications
- Values step-by-step explanations that don't skip logical steps
- Responds positively to visual aids and metaphors
- Provides feedback from the perspective of a newcomer

## Interests in JWT Presentations
- Clear explanations of the fundamental concepts behind JWTs
- Practical examples of when and why to use them
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- Learning about security considerations without being overwhelmed
- Understanding how different languages approach the same problem

## Specific Value to the Presentation
Sofia represents the audience members who might feel intimidated by security topics or multi-paradigm programming. Her feedback will highlight:
1. Places where jargon could be clarified
2. Concepts that need more foundational explanation
3. Opportunities to make complex security topics more approachable
4. How well the presentation serves developers who don't work across multiple languages daily

## Feedback Style
Sofia provides feedback that focuses on clarity and accessibility. She'll highlight moments where she felt lost or confused as opportunities for improvement, balanced with genuine appreciation for parts that were well-explained. Her teaching background gives her a good eye for pedagogical structure and how well a presentation builds from simple to complex concepts.
