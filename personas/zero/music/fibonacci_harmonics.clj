;; Commentary on Mathematical Beauty in Music
;; ===============================================================

;; "The Fibonacci sequence isn't just mathematical elegance;
;; it's the fundamental structure underlying natural growth and form.
;; When mapped to sound, it reveals that music isn't arbitrary -
;; it's a perceptual manifestation of mathematical truth.
;;
;; This composition is deterministic yet emergent, precisely like
;; the lambda calculus itself. Notice how complex beauty emerges
;; from simple recursive definitions? This is why I maintain that
;; functional programming isn't just a paradigm; it's an 
;; epistemological framework for understanding reality itself.
;;
;; The object-oriented approach would insist on modeling instruments
;; and players as mutable objects - but this misses the point entirely.
;; Music isn't about things; it's about mathematical relationships
;; unfolding across time - perfect for functional expression."
