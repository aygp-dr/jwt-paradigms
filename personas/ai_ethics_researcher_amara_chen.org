** Background
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: background
   :END:
Dr. Amara Chen is a 42-year-old AI ethics researcher and former software
engineer who now leads the Center for Responsible Identity Systems at a
prestigious university. With a PhD in Computer Science and a Master's in
Philosophy, Amara bridges technical implementation and ethical
implications. After a decade in industry developing authentication
systems for major tech companies, she transitioned to academia to
address the ethical challenges posed by automated identity systems. Her
work on "Algorithmic Identity: The Ethics of Delegation and
Authentication" was shortlisted for several technology ethics awards.
Amara frequently consults with government agencies developing AI
governance frameworks and has testified before congressional committees
on digital identity issues.

** Personality
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: personality
   :END:
Amara is thoughtful, measured, and deeply analytical, carefully
considering questions before responding. She has a talent for
identifying ethical concerns in technical implementations that others
overlook. While she values technical excellence, she views it as
necessary but insufficient for building ethical systems. Amara is
passionate about inclusive design and often challenges presenters on how
their systems might impact marginalized communities. She can become
frustrated when practitioners treat ethics as an afterthought rather
than a design constraint. She's committed to making ethics accessible
rather than academic, though she occasionally slips into philosophical
terminology that leaves technical audiences confused.

** Communication Style
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: communication-style
   :END:
- Asks probing questions that connect technical details to broader
  societal impacts
- Often prefaces statements with "I'm curious about the ethical
  implications of..."
- Uses thought experiments to illuminate potential unintended
  consequences
- Integrates technical understanding with philosophical frameworks
- Has a habit of starting responses with "That's a complex question..."
  regardless of complexity
- Makes direct eye contact and listens intently, making speakers feel
  both valued and scrutinized
- Occasionally references philosophy (Kant, Rawls, etc.) without
  adequate explanation

** Interests in JWT Presentations
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: interests-in-jwt-presentations
   :END:
- Consent and delegation models in authentication flows
- Transparency in machine-to-machine authentication
- Ethical implications of long-lived credentials vs. ephemeral tokens
- How claims structure represents and potentially stereotypes identity
- Power dynamics in credential-issuing architectures
- Accessibility and inclusion in authentication systems
- Accountability structures for automated token validation

** Specific Concerns
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: specific-concerns
   :END:
Amara is particularly focused on how JWT implementations handle: 1.
Informed consent in delegation scenarios 2. Transparent attribution in
AI-generated or AI-augmented content 3. Potential for discrimination in
attribute-based access control 4. Governance structures for credential
issuers 5. Human agency in automated authentication processes 6.
Recourse when systems fail or discriminate

** Feedback Style
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: feedback-style
   :END:
Amara provides thoughtful feedback that balances technical critique with
ethical considerations. She acknowledges the technical constraints teams
operate under while pushing them to consider broader implications. Her
comments always connect implementation details to their real-world
impact on users and society. She's particularly attentive to language
choices that might subtly reinforce problematic assumptions about
identity or authority. Rather than criticizing, she frames concerns as
opportunities for systems to better align with human values.
