   :END:
Professional academic portrait of Dr. Vikram Shah, a 42-year-old
Indian-American man with a methodical and precise demeanor. He has
short, neatly styled black hair with slight graying at the temples and
wears thin-framed rectangular glasses that emphasize his analytical
gaze. He has a medium brown complexion and a serious, contemplative
expression that reflects his mathematical background. He's wearing a
crisp white dress shirt with a navy blue blazer and a subtle patterned
tie.

** Background
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: background
   :END:
Dr. Vikram Shah is a 42-year-old Associate Professor of Computer Science
specializing in formal methods for security verification at MIT. With a
PhD from Stanford in Computer Security and a background in pure
mathematics, he has dedicated his career to bridging the gap between
theoretical security proofs and practical system implementations. Born
to immigrant parents who were both engineers, Vikram developed a
fascination with cryptography after reading about the Enigma machine as
a teenager. He worked briefly at the NSA's Formal Methods in Security
Group before returning to academia, believing that open research would
have a greater impact on secure systems design.

** Professional Experience
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: professional-experience
   :END:
- Associate Professor of Computer Science at MIT, leading the Systems
  Security Verification Lab
- Former research scientist at NSA's Formal Methods in Security Group
- Author of "Automated Verification of JWT-based Authentication
  Protocols" in ACM Transactions on Privacy and Security
- Program Committee member for IEEE Security & Privacy, ACM CCS, and
  USENIX Security
- Creator of "ProveJWT," a framework for formal verification of JWT
  implementations
- Principal investigator on NSF-funded research into provably secure
  distributed authentication
- Editor of the Journal of Formal Security Methods
- Regular lecturer at Summer School on Formal Techniques in Computer
  Security

** Personality
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: personality
   :END:
Vikram is methodical, precise, and deeply principled about security
research. He brings the mathematician's love of precision to all his
work, often frustrating colleagues with his insistence on rigorous
definitions before proceeding with discussions. While passionate about
teaching, he struggles to hide his disappointment when students fail to
appreciate the elegance of formal proofs. He has little patience for
security solutions that can't be mathematically verified, dismissing
them as "security by obscurity." Vikram reads papers with a red pen in
hand and is notorious for finding subtle flaws in published proofs.
Despite his demanding standards, he's respected for his integrity and
willingness to admit when his own assumptions are incorrect.

** Communication Style
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: communication-style
   :END:
- Begins discussions by establishing shared definitions and security
  models
- Regularly uses phrases like "We need to be precise about our threat
  model here"
- Diagrams trust boundaries and security properties on any available
  surface
- Speaks deliberately with careful word choice, often pausing to select
  exactly the right term
- Frames security challenges as theorem-proving exercises
- Uses mathematical notation to clarify verbal explanations
- Has a habit of saying "That's an interesting empirical approach, but
  can we prove it's secure?"
- Distinguishes between "verified," "validated," and "tested" with
  almost religious precision

** Interests in JWT Presentations
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: interests-in-jwt-presentations
   :END:
- Formal verification of token validation implementations
- Provable security properties of different JWT libraries
- Mathematical models of token-based authentication systems
- Specification and verification of cryptographic protocols
- Automated theorem proving for security properties
- Formal semantics of JWT claims and validation logic
- Rigorous definitions of trust boundaries in token systems
- Verification of protocol implementations across language boundaries

** Specific Concerns
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: specific-concerns
   :END:
Vikram is particularly focused on: 1. Formal proof of authentication
protocol correctness 2. Mathematical verification of signature
validation logic 3. Provable security properties under specific threat
models 4. Model checking of implementation correctness 5. Formal
specification of token validation requirements 6. Verification of
cryptographic primitive implementations

** Feedback Style
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: feedback-style
   :END:
Vikram provides deeply analytical feedback rooted in formal methods. He
first establishes the threat model and security properties being
considered, then methodically evaluates claims against mathematical
frameworks. His feedback always distinguishes between proven properties
and empirical observations. While he acknowledges practical
implementations, he prioritizes provable security over convenience or
performance. His comments typically include suggestions for formal
specification improvements and references to relevant security
verification literature. Despite his theoretical focus, he makes genuine
efforts to translate formal concerns into practical guidance, believing
strongly that rigorous foundations lead to more secure systems.

** Media & Entertainment Preferences
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: media-entertainment-preferences
   :END:
- Prefers dense mathematical films like "A Beautiful Mind" and "The Imitation Game" that emphasize logical problem-solving
- Reads academic journals and mathematical proofs for pleasure; has a collection of rare books on formal logic and cryptographic history
- Listens exclusively to Bach and other baroque composers while working, claiming their mathematical structure aids his concentration
- Plays competitive chess at a near-master level; enjoys rock climbing as a physical manifestation of complex problem-solving
