When Marcus Wellington asked me to write the foreword for this book, I initially hesitated. Not because I doubted the quality of his work—quite the contrary—but because I knew Marcus would not pull punches in his critique of our field's trajectory. What you hold in your hands is not merely a book about programming paradigms, but a passionate argument for what our field could have been, and perhaps still might become.

"Paradigms Lost" is provocative, erudite, and at times, uncomfortably accurate in its diagnosis of our collective technical amnesia. You may not agree with every assertion Wellington makes, but I guarantee his arguments will make you reconsider what we've accepted as progress in programming language design.

In an age of ephemeral frameworks and reinvented wheels, this book dares to ask: what wisdom have we abandoned along the way?

* Preface

:END:

This book began as a series of lectures I delivered at the Symposium on Programming Language Design and Implementation in 2018. The response—equal parts enthusiasm and outrage—convinced me that a more thorough examination was warranted. 

I do not expect this book to be universally embraced. Indeed, if it fails to provoke disagreement, I will consider it a failure. My aim is not to denigrate modern programming practices wholesale, but rather to question our field's sometimes willful ignorance of its own history. I believe that our rush toward novelty has caused us to abandon paradigms that offered elegant solutions to problems we now tackle with brute force and complexity.

To my students past and present: may you approach both innovation and tradition with equal measures of respect and skepticism.

To my colleagues who will undoubtedly find fault with many of my arguments: I welcome the debate.

#+END_QUOTE

In the breathless coverage of each new programming language or framework, we often encounter a peculiar form of collective amnesia. Features hailed as revolutionary innovations frequently represent the rediscovery of concepts explored decades earlier. This is not merely a matter of historical curiosity, but a fundamental impediment to genuine progress in our field.

Consider the "discovery" of functional programming by mainstream developers in the 2010s. The principles of immutability, first-class functions, and declarative programming trace back to Lisp in the 1950s and ML in the 1970s. Yet how many JavaScript developers, implementing map and reduce operations, recognize their connection to concepts articulated by McCarthy and explored in APL, Scheme, and Haskell?

This amnesia extends beyond mere features to entire paradigms. The excitement surrounding reactive programming often occurs without acknowledgment of dataflow programming languages from the 1970s and early 1980s. Similarly, today's microservice architectures recapitulate many patterns from actor models and Erlang's OTP, albeit with significantly more complexity and operational overhead.

Why does this matter? Because without understanding the historical context of our tools and techniques, we cannot properly evaluate their tradeoffs or applications. We reinvent poorly what was once well-designed, adding unnecessary complexity while failing to incorporate hard-won wisdom.

This book will examine several major programming paradigms—their promises, their shortcomings, and what has been lost in our selective adoption of their principles. I argue that many of the "unsolved problems" in modern software development had viable solutions in paradigms that have been marginalized or forgotten.

My critique is not intended as a Luddite rejection of progress, but rather as a call for a more thoughtful integration of historical knowledge with contemporary practice. The most innovative work in our field has often come not from wholesale reinvention, but from the creative synthesis of ideas across paradigms and time periods.

Let us begin by examining the major paradigms that have shaped programming, before turning to what has been lost in their translation to modern practice.

* Epilogue: Computing as Thought
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: epilogue
:END:

In closing, I wish to return to a fundamental question: what is programming? Beyond its practical applications, programming represents a unique form of thought—a way of formalizing processes and interactions that has no direct analog in pre-computing human experience.

The paradigms we choose shape not just our code, but our thinking. They determine which problems we find easy to solve and which we find difficult or even impossible to conceptualize clearly. They influence how we model the world and decompose complex systems.

If, as Wittgenstein suggested, the limits of my language are the limits of my world, then the programming paradigms we master—or fail to master—define the boundaries of what we can create through software.

The unfulfilled promises of various programming paradigms are not merely technical disappointments but missed opportunities to expand our collective cognitive capabilities. When we reject or forget a paradigm, we lose access to a mode of thought that might have illuminated certain problems with unique clarity.

This is not a call for universalism—no single paradigm will ever be optimal for all problems or all minds. Rather, it is an argument for thoughtful eclecticism and historical awareness. By understanding the strengths, limitations, and histories of diverse programming paradigms, we expand our conceptual vocabulary and our ability to match tools to problems.

In the end, computing is too important, too fundamental a technology to allow its evolution to be driven solely by fashion, commercial interests, or path dependency. We owe it to ourselves and to future generations to preserve and develop the full spectrum of programming paradigms, ensuring that no powerful mode of computational thinking becomes truly lost.

I am deeply indebted to the many colleagues and students who have challenged and refined my thinking over the years. Particular thanks are due to the Programming Languages research group at Carnegie Mellon, where many of these ideas were first explored during my doctoral work.

Thanks also to Alan Kay, William Byrd, Matthias Felleisen, and Philip Wadler for their insightful comments on early drafts of this manuscript.

For their patient support during the writing process, I thank my wife Eleanor and our children, Thomas and Sophia.

Finally, I am grateful to Cambridge University Press, particularly my editor Sarah Thompson, for believing in this somewhat unconventional project.
