:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: preface
:END:

This commonplace book began during my doctoral studies at Carnegie Mellon in 1988. 
I have maintained it continuously since then, collecting insights, proofs, and algorithms
that strike me as particularly elegant or thought-provoking. It serves as both an
intellectual repository and a teaching resource.

Unlike most of my academic publications, this collection follows no predetermined
structure. It is organized chronologically by date of entry, though I have retroactively
added subject tags to facilitate cross-referencing.

I share selections from this collection with my students as examples of clarity and
elegant thinking across programming paradigms. The best entries demonstrate how a
single idea can be expressed across multiple languages and paradigms, revealing both
the universal nature of computational thinking and the unique characteristics of
different approaches.

** Quicksort in Different Paradigms :sorting:algorithms:paradigms:comparisons:
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED: [1990-04-18]
:END:

The elegance of Hoare's Quicksort algorithm is best appreciated through multiple paradigms:

*** Imperative (C)
#+BEGIN_SRC c
void swap(int *a, int *b) {
    int t = *a;
    *a = *b;
    *b = t;
}

int partition(int arr[], int low, int high) {
    int pivot = arr[high];
    int i = (low - 1);
    
    for (int j = low; j <= high - 1; j++) {
        if (arr[j] < pivot) {
            i++;
            swap(&arr[i], &arr[j]);
        }
    }
    swap(&arr[i + 1], &arr[high]);
    return (i + 1);
}

void quickSort(int arr[], int low, int high) {
    if (low < high) {
        int pi = partition(arr, low, high);
        quickSort(arr, low, pi - 1);
        quickSort(arr, pi + 1, high);
    }
}
#+END_SRC

*** Functional (Haskell)
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
quicksort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
quicksort [] = []
quicksort (x:xs) = 
    let smaller = quicksort [a | a <- xs, a <= x]
        larger  = quicksort [a | a <- xs, a > x]
    in  smaller ++ [x] ++ larger
#+END_SRC

/Note: While elegant, this is not the most efficient implementation in Haskell. It creates unnecessary intermediate lists and doesn't do in-place sorting. A proper implementation would use arrays and monadic code, but would lose the simple beauty shown here./

*** Logic Programming (Prolog)
#+BEGIN_SRC prolog
partition([], _, [], []).
partition([X|Xs], Pivot, [X|Smaller], Larger) :-
    X =< Pivot, partition(Xs, Pivot, Smaller, Larger).
partition([X|Xs], Pivot, Smaller, [X|Larger]) :-
    X > Pivot, partition(Xs, Pivot, Smaller, Larger).

quicksort([], []).
quicksort([Head|Tail], Sorted) :-
    partition(Tail, Head, Smaller, Larger),
    quicksort(Smaller, SortedSmaller),
    quicksort(Larger, SortedLarger),
    append(SortedSmaller, [Head|SortedLarger], Sorted).
#+END_SRC

/Observation: The logical specification in Prolog reveals the underlying mathematical relationship most clearly. The partition relation precisely encodes the core insight of quicksort./

** Y Combinator - Making Recursion Without Names :recursion:lambda_calculus:functional_programming:
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED: [1995-11-05]
:END:

The Y Combinator demonstrates the power of mathematical abstraction in creating recursion without explicit naming:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :tangle commonplace/y_combinator.scm :mkdirp yes
;; The Y combinator
(define Y
  (lambda (f)
    ((lambda (x) (f (lambda (y) ((x x) y))))
     (lambda (x) (f (lambda (y) ((x x) y)))))))

;; Using Y to define factorial
(define factorial
  (Y (lambda (f)
       (lambda (n)
         (if (zero? n)
             1
             (* n (f (- n 1))))))))

;; Test
(factorial 5) ; => 120
#+END_SRC

/Note (2018): I still recall the moment when I first understood how Y worksit was like seeing the mathematical universe from a new angle. The ability to derive recursion from pure lambda calculus without requiring a named function remains one of the most elegant demonstrations of the power of functional abstraction./

** Church Encoding: Pure Lambda Calculus :lambda_calculus:church_encoding:foundations:
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED: [1992-08-17]
:END:

Church numerals represent perhaps the most elegant encoding of natural numbers in pure theory:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme :tangle commonplace/church.scm :mkdirp yes
;; Church numerals
(define zero (lambda (f) (lambda (x) x)))
(define one (lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f x))))
(define two (lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f (f x)))))
(define three (lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f (f (f x))))))

;; Successor function
(define succ 
  (lambda (n)
    (lambda (f)
      (lambda (x)
        (f ((n f) x))))))

;; Addition
(define add
  (lambda (m)
    (lambda (n)
      (lambda (f)
        (lambda (x)
          ((m f) ((n f) x)))))))

;; Multiplication
(define mult
  (lambda (m)
    (lambda (n)
      (lambda (f)
        (m (n f))))))

;; Church to integer conversion (for demonstration)
(define church->int
  (lambda (church)
    ((church (lambda (n) (+ n 1))) 0)))

;; Test
(church->int (((add two) three))) ; => 5
(church->int ((mult two) three))  ; => 6
#+END_SRC

/Reflection: Church's encoding demonstrates that something as seemingly basic as numbers can be represented using only functions. The profound insight here is that computation can be expressed entirely through function application, without requiring primitive data types./

** The Curry-Howard Correspondence :logic:type_theory:programming_languages:
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED: [1997-02-12]
:END:

The Curry-Howard correspondence illuminates the deep connection between logic and computation:

| Logical System | Programming Concept |
|----------------+---------------------|
| Proposition    | Type                |
| Proof          | Program/Term        |
| Conjunction    | Product Type        |
| Disjunction    | Sum Type            |
| Implication    | Function Type       |
| Universal     | Polymorphic Type    |
| Existential   | Abstract Data Type  |

Every well-typed program can be viewed as a proof of its type proposition. This insight has profound implications for verification and programming language design.

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell :tangle commonplace/curry_howard.hs :mkdirp yes
-- Logical AND corresponds to product types
-- Proof that A AND B implies A
fst :: (a, b) -> a
fst (a, _) = a

** Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems :logic:foundations:metalogic:
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED: [1999-09-20]
:END:

G�del's incompleteness theorems represent one of the most profound results in mathematical logic:

1. First Incompleteness Theorem: Any consistent formal system F within which a certain amount of elementary arithmetic can be carried out is incomplete; i.e., there are statements of the language of F which can neither be proved nor disproved in F.

2. Second Incompleteness Theorem: For any consistent system F within which a certain amount of elementary arithmetic can be carried out, the consistency of F cannot be proved in F itself.

The implications for computing are profound: there will always be true statements about programs that cannot be proven within our formal verification systems. We can never have a complete algorithmic solution to program verification.

/Note: I often refer to G�del's work when discussing the limitations of formal methods and type systems with overly ambitious students. Understanding these fundamental limitations is crucial to designing practical verification approaches./

** Proof That There Are Infinitely Many Primes :number_theory:proof_by_contradiction:
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED: [1989-11-03]
:END:

This classic proof from Euclid demonstrates the power of proof by contradiction:

Suppose, for contradiction, that there are only finitely many primes: $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$.

Consider the number $Q = p_1 \times p_2 \times \ldots \times p_n + 1$.

Now, $Q$ is either prime or composite.

If $Q$ is prime, then we have found a prime not in our list, contradicting our assumption.

If $Q$ is composite, then it must be divisible by some prime $p_i$ in our list.
But $Q \cong 1 \pmod{p_i}$ for all $i$, meaning $Q$ leaves remainder 1 when divided by any $p_i$.
Thus, no $p_i$ can divide $Q$, which is a contradiction.

Therefore, our assumption must be false, and there are infinitely many primes.

/Observation: This proof has the same elegant structure as many proofs in computer scienceparticularly those involving uncomputability and undecidability. The technique of assuming a finite enumeration and then constructing a counterexample is used in proofs from the halting problem to Rice's theorem./

** The Essence of Functional Programming :functional_programming:monads:abstractions:
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED: [2000-07-15]

Monads represent one of the most powerful abstractions in functional programming, allowing us to encapsulate computational effects:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell :tangle commonplace/monads.hs :mkdirp yes
-- The Maybe monad
-- Representing computations that might fail
data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
  deriving (Show)

instance Functor Maybe where
    fmap _ Nothing = Nothing
    fmap f (Just x) = Just (f x)

instance Applicative Maybe where
    pure = Just
    Nothing <*> _ = Nothing
    (Just f) <*> x = fmap f x

instance Monad Maybe where
    return x = Just x
    Nothing >>= _ = Nothing
    (Just x) >>= f = f x
    
-- The List monad
-- Representing non-deterministic computations
instance Monad [] where
    return x = [x]
    xs >>= f = concat (map f xs)
    
-- The State monad
-- Representing stateful computations
newtype State s a = State { runState :: s -> (a, s) }

instance Functor (State s) where
    fmap f m = State $ \s -> 
        let (a, s') = runState m s
        in (f a, s')

instance Applicative (State s) where
    pure a = State $ \s -> (a, s)
    sf <*> sx = State $ \s ->
        let (f, s') = runState sf s
            (x, s'') = runState sx s'
        in (f x, s'')

instance Monad (State s) where
    return a = State $ \s -> (a, s)
    m >>= f = State $ \s ->
        let (a, s') = runState m s
        in runState (f a) s'

-- Example: Computing with Maybe
safeDiv :: Int -> Int -> Maybe Int
safeDiv _ 0 = Nothing
safeDiv x y = Just (x `div` y)

computation :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Maybe Int
computation x y z = do
    a <- safeDiv x y
    b <- safeDiv z 2
    return (a + b)

    print $ computation 10 0 4      -- Nothing
    print $ computation 10 2 0      -- Just 5
    
    putStrLn "\nList Monad Tests:"
    print $ [1,2,3] >>= \x -> [x, x*2]  -- [1,2,2,4,3,6]
    
    putStrLn "\nState Monad Tests:"
    let incState = State $ \s -> (s, s+1)
    print $ runState (incState >>= \x -> return (x*2)) 1  -- (2,2)
#+END_SRC

/Reflection (2018): When I first encountered monads, I thought they were unnecessarily complex. Now I see them as one of the most elegant patterns in programmingallowing pure functional code to express effects while maintaining referential transparency. The ability to separate what computation is performed from how it is executed represents a profound separation of concerns./

** The Expression Problem :language_design:extensibility:OOP:FP:

/Note (2017): The Expression Problem reveals a fundamental tension between different paradigms. Neither OOP nor FP solves it completely. Solutions like Scala's traits, Haskell's typeclasses, OCaml's polymorphic variants, and Clojure's protocols are all attempts to bridge this gap. This remains an area where language design continues to evolve./

** Algol and the Birth of Structured Programming :programming_languages:history:structured_programming:

Algol represents a pivotal moment in programming language design. Its innovations included:

1. Block structure with nested lexical scopes
2. Pass-by-value and pass-by-name parameters
3. Recursive procedures
4. Static typing
5. BNF as a formal language definition tool

/Personal note: During my graduate studies, I had the privilege of meeting Peter Naur, who shared fascinating stories about the committee meetings that shaped Algol. The desire to create a language that could express algorithms clearly for humans, not just computers, was revolutionary at the time./

** The Birth and Death of Smalltalk :OOP:smalltalk:history:language_design:
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED: [1996-05-20]
:END:

Alan Kay's vision for Smalltalk was far more revolutionary than what object-oriented programming eventually became:

1. Everything is an object
2. Computation occurs by message passing
3. The system is fully live and inspectable
4. The environment and language are integrated

/Reflection: Much of what made Smalltalk revolutionary was lost in its commercial descendants like C++ and Java. The integration of environment and language, the live coding experience, and the uniform treatment of objects were all compromised in the transition to static, compiled languages. I often wonder how different software development would be today if we had followed the Smalltalk path more faithfully./

Japan's Fifth Generation Computer Systems project (1982-1992) represented an ambitious attempt to revolutionize computing based on logic programming. Its goals included:

1. Parallel inference machines
2. Natural language processing
3. Intelligent knowledge base systems
4. New hardware architectures

/Note: The project's perceived failure had more to do with overambitious goals and marketing than with fundamental flaws in its technical approach. Many of its innovations in parallel logic programming were ahead of their time. With the revival of AI in the 2010s, I find myself returning to papers from this era and discovering insights that are newly relevant./

** The von Neumann Architecture vs. Functional Model :architecture:models_of_computation:teaching:
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED: [2005-10-12]
:END:

I use this comparison in introductory lectures to illustrate the fundamental tension between our hardware architecture and certain programming paradigms:

*** The von Neumann Bottleneck
The von Neumann architecture, which underlies most modern computers, features:
- A processing unit
- A control unit
- Memory that contains both data and instructions
- Sequential execution model
- State changes through assignment

This architecture has a fundamental bottleneck: instructions and data travel along the same path between CPU and memory, limiting performance.

*** The Functional Model
In contrast, functional programming models computation as:
- Evaluation of mathematical functions
- Avoidance of mutable state
- Emphasis on transformation rather than assignment
- Natural parallelism
- Referential transparency

/Teaching note: I use this comparison to help students understand why functional programming sometimes feels "unnatural" initially, despite its mathematical elegance. We are fighting against the mental model reinforced by our hardware architecture./

-- Expression: \f -> \x -> f (f x)

-- Step 1: Assign type variables
-- f :: a

-- Step 3: Generate constraints from application f (f x)
-- f is applied to (f x), which has type c
-- This creates another constraint: a = (c -> d) (for some d)

-- Step 4: Unify constraints
-- a = (b -> c) and a = (c -> d)
-- Therefore: (b -> c) = (c -> d)
-- Which gives us: b = c and c = d

-- Step 5: Substitute
-- b = c = d
-- Therefore, the inferred type is: (b -> b) -> b -> b

-- In Haskell notation:
-- :t \f -> \x -> f (f x)
-- (\f -> \x -> f (f x)) :: (b -> b) -> b -> b

-- Actual runnable version for testing
twice :: (b -> b) -> b -> b
twice f x = f (f x)

-- Test with simple functions
main = do
  print $ twice (+1) 0        -- Should print 2
  print $ twice (*2) 3        -- Should print 12
  print $ twice reverse [1,2,3] -- Should print [1,2,3]

/Teaching note: Walking through the type inference process step by step helps students understand both the power and the limitations of Hindley-Milner type systems. I find this particular example valuable because it demonstrates how constraints propagate and how the most general type is derived./

** The Halting Problem Explained Through Paradox :computability:theoretical_cs:teaching:
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED: [2008-03-04]
:END:

When teaching the halting problem, I use this pseudocode to illustrate the fundamental paradox:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle commonplace/halting_problem.py :mkdirp yes
def halts(program, input):
    """Determine if program will halt when run with input."""
    # This is the function we are proving cannot exist
    ...

def paradox(program):
    """Create a paradoxical situation if halts() exists."""
    if halts(program, program):
        # If program would halt when run on itself,
        # then loop forever
        while True:
            pass
    else:
        # If program would loop forever when run on itself,
        # then halt immediately
        return

# The paradox
paradox(paradox)
#+END_SRC

If we assume `halts()` exists and works correctly:
- If `paradox(paradox)` halts, then by the definition of `paradox()`, it should loop forever - contradiction!
- If `paradox(paradox)` loops forever, then by the definition of `paradox()`, it should halt - contradiction!

Therefore, `halts()` cannot exist. The halting problem is undecidable.

/Teaching note: Students often struggle with the abstract nature of the proof by diagonalization. This concrete implementation helps them visualize the paradox. I emphasize how similar this is to other paradoxes they may be familiar with, like the liar paradox ("This statement is false")./

*** Notable Portrayals of Computing in Film

| Film | Year | Computational Concepts |
|------|------|------------------------|
| [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/][The Social Network]] | 2010 | Network effects, Scaling |
| [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084970][The Imitation Game]] | 2014 | Cryptography, Computability |
| [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390384][Primer]] | 2004 | Recursion, Parallel execution |
| [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062622][2001: A Space Odyssey]] | 1968 | AI, Human-computer interaction |
| [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086567][WarGames]] | 1983 | Game theory, Security |
| [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113957][Hackers]] | 1995 | Security (inaccurate) |
| [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0168122][The Matrix]] | 1999 | Simulation, Virtual worlds |

I've found "The Social Network" particularly fascinating despite its dramatization of events. Its portrayal of algorithm development (the facemash sequence) represents one of the few mainstream films to show actual coding with some degree of accuracy. The film's narrative arc also inadvertently illustrates the tension between implementation and interface design — Zuckerberg's character is portrayed as technically brilliant but interpersonally limited, a stereotype that does our profession few favors.

/Note (2023): I recently revisited this film for a course on "Ethics in Computing" and found it serves as an excellent conversation starter for discussing intellectual property, attribution of ideas, and the social consequences of technical decisions./

*** Television Series with Computational Themes

| [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2575988/][Silicon Valley]] | 2014-2019 | Compression, Startups |
| [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3659388/][Halt and Catch Fire]] | 2014-2017 | HCI, Operating systems |
| [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4158110/][Mr. Robot]] | 2015-2019 | Security, Cryptography |
| [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8134186/][Devs]] | 2020 | Quantum computing, Determinism |
| [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4574334/][Stranger Things]] | 2016-present | Early computing, Networks |
| [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0487831/][The IT Crowd]] | 2006-2013 | Technical support (satirical) |

Silicon Valley stands out for its accurate, if exaggerated, portrayal of startup culture and technical concepts. The "middle-out compression" algorithm serves as a surprisingly effective vehicle for explaining computational complexity and optimization to non-technical audiences. I've occasionally used clips from the series in lectures to demonstrate how technical concepts can be made accessible without completely sacrificing accuracy.

/Note (2023): I've developed a detailed analytic framework for evaluating the technical accuracy of computing portrayals in media, which I'm preparing for publication. The working title is "Computational Verisimilitude: A Framework for Evaluating Technical Accuracy in Popular Media."/

** On Teaching Programming Language Concepts :pedagogy:personal:
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED: [2019-06-18]
:END:

After three decades of teaching programming language concepts, I've observed that the most common struggle for students is not with the technical details but with shifting their mental models. Whether it's moving from imperative to functional, from static to dynamic typing, or from concrete to abstract thinking, the challenge is often unlearning rather than learning.

I've found that concrete analogies from non-computing domains can be surprisingly effective:
- Describing monads as assembly lines
- Comparing type systems to systems of mathematical notation
- Relating polymorphism to architectural patterns

The most rewarding moments come when I see a student experience that "aha!" momentwhen a concept they've been struggling with suddenly clicks into place and they can see its elegance and utility.

** On the Cycles of Programming Fashion :history:trends:critique:
:PROPERTIES:
:CREATED: [2020-11-24]
:END:

In my career, I've witnessed several complete cycles of programming fashion:
- The rise, fall, and resurrection of functional programming
- The explosion of object-oriented programming, followed by a backlash and then moderation
- The swing between static and dynamic typing, now settling into gradual typing
- The oscillation between monolithic and distributed architectures

What troubles me is how rarely these cycles acknowledge their historical antecedents. Each generation seems determined to relearn the same lessons, often making the same mistakes along the way.

The field would benefit from a stronger sense of history and a more critical examination of claims of novelty. Many "innovations" are rediscoveries, sometimes with terminology just different enough to obscure their origins.

/Personal note: I sometimes feel like Cassandra, doomed to see the future (because it's repeating the past) while being ignored. My hope is that by documenting these patterns for my students, at least some will approach new trends with healthy skepticism and historical awareness./
