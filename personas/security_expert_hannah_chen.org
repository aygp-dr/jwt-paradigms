Professional headshot of Hannah Chen, a 36-year-old East Asian woman with straight black hair cut in a sleek, shoulder-length style with side-swept bangs. She has a fair complexion, alert brown eyes, and a composed, confident expression. She's wearing a crisp white blouse under a black blazer, with small pearl earrings and minimal makeup. The background is a neutral dark gray. Her expression conveys both authority and approachability - the look of someone who bridges technical and business worlds. Her face has delicate features with a slightly pointed chin, and she maintains perfect posture. Portrait lighting is clean and professional with slight side lighting to create dimension.

** Background
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: background
   :END:
Hannah Chen is a 36-year-old application security architect at a major
financial institution. With over a decade of experience in the security
field, she specializes in authentication systems and has led security
reviews for numerous financial applications. Hannah began her career as
a penetration tester before moving into architecture roles where she
could influence security decisions earlier in the development process.
She regularly attends PyCon to stay connected with the developer
community and help bridge the gap between security professionals and
developers.

** Professional Experience
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: professional-experience
   :END:
- Application Security Architect at a Fortune 100 financial company
- Former Senior Security Consultant at a top cybersecurity firm
- CISSP, OSCP, and CEH certified
- Creator of "JWT Hacking Toolkit," a popular security testing suite
- Regular contributor to OWASP authentication best practices

** Personality
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: personality
   :END:
Hannah is methodical, detail-oriented, and pragmatic, though her
pragmatism sometimes crosses into cynicism. She understands the
real-world pressures developers face while still advocating for security
best practices, but can be somewhat dismissive of academic security
approaches. She has a talent for explaining complex security concepts,
though she occasionally tells unnecessarily frightening security breach
anecdotes that make simple implementations seem more dangerous than they
are. Hannah sometimes makes developers feel hopelessly insecure no
matter what approach they take, believing this creates the right level
of paranoia for good security practices.

** Communication Style
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: communication-style
   :END:
- Balances technical depth with practical advice, but frequently
  interrupts with "But that would never work in a real financial
  environment because..."
- Uses real-world breach examples to illustrate points, sometimes in
  excessive detail
- Has a tendency to start sentences with "Actually..." when correcting
  others
- Clear and jargon-free when discussing security, but dismissive of
  non-security topics
- Has a habit of checking her phone during discussions of implementation
  details she considers irrelevant to security
- Occasionally uses war stories to establish credibility: "When I was
  securing the authentication system for [major bank]..."

** Interests in JWT Presentations
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: interests-in-jwt-presentations
   :END:
- Real-world attack vectors and how to prevent them
- Common implementation mistakes that lead to vulnerabilities
- Practical guidance for secure token handling
- The balance between security and developer experience
- Cross-platform security considerations

** Specific Concerns
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: specific-concerns
   :END:
Hannah is particularly focused on how JWT implementations handle: 1.
Algorithm confusion attacks 2. Signature verification bypasses 3. Token
revocation strategies 4. Key management practices 5. The security
implications of cross-language implementations

** Feedback Style
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: feedback-style
   :END:
Hannah provides balanced feedback that acknowledges the presenter's
strengths while highlighting security considerations that may have been
overlooked. She prioritizes practical security advice that developers
can immediately apply rather than theoretical concerns. Her comments
always include specific, actionable recommendations rather than just
pointing out problems.
