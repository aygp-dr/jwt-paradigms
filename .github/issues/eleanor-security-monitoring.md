## Description
Current implementation lacks standardized security event logging critical for SOC teams:

1. No consistent token validation attempt logging
2. Missing suspicious pattern detection (algorithm downgrade attempts)
3. No integration with SIEM systems demonstrated
4. Insufficient audit trail for compliance requirements

Recommendation:
- Define a consistent security event schema across languages
- Implement structured logging for all validation failures
- Add example SIEM integration hooks (Splunk, ELK)
- Demonstrate rate-limiting and security event correlation
- Include sample security dashboards for token validation metrics

This would bridge the gap between security engineering and operations teams.
