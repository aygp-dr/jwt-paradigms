## Description
The presentation mentions Base64url encoding challenges but lacks a structured comparison across languages:

1. Create a dedicated table comparing Base64url handling approaches across all languages
2. Add explicit examples of how each language handles:
   - Character substitution (- → +, _ → /)
   - Padding calculation
   - Encoding/decoding efficiency
3. Include common pitfalls and edge cases for Base64url handling
4. Add performance metrics for Base64url operations across languages

This would provide developers with critical information about a fundamental JWT parsing challenge that affects all implementations.
