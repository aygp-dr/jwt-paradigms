title: Bridge Security Implementation Gap in Code Examples
labels: security, enhancement, documentation

## Description
The presentation has a security recommendations section, but many code examples don't fully implement these practices:

1. Update all language examples to include a "secure" implementation alongside the simplified version
2. Add explicit markers showing which security best practices each example implements
3. Create a "security checklist" matrix across language examples
4. Include references to CVEs or security incidents related to each vulnerability

Implementing these changes would ensure developers can see both the simplified parsing examples and production-ready secure implementations, reducing the risk of insecure deployments.
