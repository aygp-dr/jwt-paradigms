title: Improve Python Base64URL Handling with Consistent Utility Functions

## Description
Current Python examples repeat complex base64url encoding/decoding logic across multiple files with slight variations. This increases the risk of implementation errors and makes the code harder to maintain.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Compare base64url decoding in examples/python/jwt_header.py and examples/parsing-validation/python_parsing.py
2. Note the duplicated padding calculation and character replacement logic

Expected outcome:
A shared utility function for base64url encoding/decoding that ensures consistent handling and reduces code duplication.

Implementation suggestion:
- Create a `jwt_utils.py` module with standardized encoding/decoding functions
- Replace existing implementations with calls to these utility functions
- Add proper type hints and comprehensive docstrings
- Include unit tests that verify handling of edge cases (missing padding, URL-unsafe characters)
