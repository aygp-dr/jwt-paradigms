title: Standardize Security Warnings in All JWT Parsing Examples

## Description
All code examples should consistently emphasize signature verification before parsing. Currently, some examples include proper warnings while others (especially the Python slide example) don't sufficiently highlight this critical security requirement.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Review presentation.org line 157-183 (Python Implementation)
2. Compare with examples/parsing-validation/python_parsing.py

Expected outcome:
All examples should include prominent warnings about verification requirements and explicitly demonstrate the proper order of operations (verify first, then parse).

Implementation suggestion:
- Add a standardized warning template to all language examples
- Include references to secure implementation patterns
- Consider visually highlighting security warnings with consistent formatting
