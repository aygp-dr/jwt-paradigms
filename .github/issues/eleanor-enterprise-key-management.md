title: Enhance Key Management for Enterprise-Scale Identity Systems
labels: security, enterprise, strategic

## Description
The current JWT implementation examples need enterprise-grade key management considerations:

1. Missing HSM integration patterns for high-security environments
2. No key rotation mechanisms for compliance with regulatory requirements
3. Limited discussion of key distribution for multi-region deployments
4. No examples of certificate-based validation for cross-organizational trust

For enterprise identity systems, implement:
- Clear HSM integration patterns (AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, GCP KMS)
- Automated key rotation with zero-downtime transition
- Certificate-based validation examples
- Multi-region key distribution strategies

This enhancement would prepare these patterns for enterprise adoption.
