title: Standardize Error Handling Patterns Across Language Examples
labels: enhancement, polyglot-patterns
assignees: aygp-dr

## Description
The presentation shows inconsistent error handling approaches across languages. We should improve this by:

1. Adding a dedicated section comparing error handling idioms across languages
2. Enhancing examples to demonstrate language-specific best practices for JWT validation errors
3. Creating a "decision tree" for choosing appropriate error handling approaches
4. Updating code examples to include consistent error categorization (invalid format, expired token, signature mismatch)

This would help developers understand not just how to parse JWTs, but how to properly handle invalid tokens across language boundaries.
