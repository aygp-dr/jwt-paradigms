## Description
The current refresh token implementation lacks important security features needed in production systems, including token fingerprinting, proper key rotation, and comprehensive revocation strategies.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Review examples/refresh/python_refresh.py
2. Note the basic Redis implementation for revocation

Expected outcome:
A more comprehensive Python example demonstrating best practices for secure token revocation, including:
- Token fingerprinting to prevent token exfiltration attacks
- Key rotation strategies with versioning
- Blacklisting approach for immediate revocation
- Rate limiting for refresh token usage
- Automatic revocation on suspicious activity

Implementation suggestion:
- Enhance the TokenService class with additional security features
- Add a section on token security lifecycle management
- Include examples of detecting and responding to potential token compromise
- Document the tradeoffs between different revocation strategies
