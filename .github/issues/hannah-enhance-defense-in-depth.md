## Description
The presentation effectively covers direct JWT validation techniques but lacks sufficient guidance on integrating JWTs into a defense-in-depth security strategy.

Recommendations:
- Add section on complementary security controls beyond JWT validation
- Include rate limiting examples to prevent brute force attacks on tokens
- Demonstrate integrating JWT validation with additional contextual checks (IP validation, device fingerprinting)
- Provide monitoring/logging examples to detect unusual JWT usage patterns
- Discuss SIEM integration for JWT-based authentication systems
- Include examples of canary tokens for breach detection

For financial applications, JWT validation alone is insufficient - we need to demonstrate a comprehensive security approach.
