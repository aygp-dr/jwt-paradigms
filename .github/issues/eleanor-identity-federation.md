title: Add Identity Federation Patterns for Cross-Organization Trust

## Description
Current JWT implementations lack enterprise federation patterns:

1. No OIDC/OAuth2 compliant token validation examples
2. Missing external IdP validation flows (Azure AD, Okta, Auth0)
3. No examples handling multi-tenant token validation
4. Limited cross-organization validation patterns

Proposed enhancements:
- Add standard OIDC discovery endpoint integration
- Implement JWKS endpoint consumption with caching
- Demonstrate tenant isolation in multi-tenant environments
- Include examples for cross-organization token validation chains
- Add proper handling of varying claim formats between providers

This would significantly enhance the enterprise applicability of these JWT parsing examples.
