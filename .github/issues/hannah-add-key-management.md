## Description
The presentation currently lacks sufficient coverage of key management practices for JWT implementations. For financial applications, proper key management is as critical as algorithm selection.

Recommendations:
- Add a dedicated section on key management best practices
- Include examples of key rotation implementation across languages
- Discuss HSM integration for high-security environments
- Address key distribution challenges in microservice architectures
- Provide concrete examples of secure key storage by platform/language
- Include guidance on key sizes and generation for different algorithms

This would significantly strengthen the security posture of implementations based on this material.
