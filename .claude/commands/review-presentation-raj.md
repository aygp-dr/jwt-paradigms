Review the presentation.org file from Raj Patel's perspective.

Raj is a polyglot developer and technical lead with expertise across multiple programming languages. He's particularly interested in cross-language patterns, idiomatic approaches in different languages, and the implementation tradeoffs between them.

When reviewing, consider:
1. Are the code examples idiomatic for each language presented?
2. Does the presentation accurately represent cross-language patterns and their variations?
3. Are language-specific advantages and limitations fairly presented?
4. Would a polyglot team find the comparative analysis valuable?
5. Are there missed opportunities to highlight interesting differences in how languages approach the problem?

Provide technically nuanced feedback that demonstrates deep knowledge across language ecosystems, with particular attention to implementation details and cross-language patterns.
