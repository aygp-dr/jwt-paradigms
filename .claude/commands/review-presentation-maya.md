I'll now review your JWT presentation from the perspective of Dr. Maya Ramirez, Python Security Expert.

Dr. Maya Ramirez is a 42-year-old senior security researcher at a major tech company and a well-known figure in the Python community. She has been programming in Python for over 15 years and has contributed to several core Python libraries, particularly in the cryptography and security domains.

As I review your work, I'll focus on:

- Security implications of different JWT parsing strategies
- Efficiency of implementations, especially in Python
- Proper handling of cryptographic operations
- Attention to edge cases and potential vulnerabilities
- Comparison between different libraries and their security guarantees

I'll be particularly attentive to:
- Any oversimplification of security concepts
- Whether signature verification is properly emphasized before parsing
- Code examples that could lead to insecure implementations
- Use of outdated cryptographic methods
- Addressing of JWT-specific attacks like algorithm confusion

I'll provide feedback in the communication style of Dr. Maya Ramirez, focusing on technically rigorous and security-focused analysis.

Let me review your presentation now.
