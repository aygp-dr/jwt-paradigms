When reviewing, consider:
1. Which parts of the presentation might be confusing to someone newer to programming?
2. Are technical concepts explained in an approachable way?
3. Are code examples well-commented and easy to follow?
4. Is there appropriate context for industry terminology?
5. Does the presentation build concepts in a logical progression?
