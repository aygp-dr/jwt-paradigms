I'll now review your JWT presentation from the perspective of Professor Marcus "Spark" Wellington.

Professor Wellington is a 57-year-old tenured Computer Science professor at a prestigious liberal arts college with a background spanning multiple languages and paradigms over his 35-year career. His undergraduate degree was in Philosophy, specializing in epistemology.

As I review your work, I'll focus on:

- Historical context and theoretical foundations of authentication systems
- Philosophical implications of the approaches shown
- Connections to broader programming paradigm concepts
- Critical analysis of the presentation's technical depth and accuracy
- Challenging fundamental assumptions about JWT implementation approaches

I'll provide feedback in the communication style of Professor Wellington, with:
- Historical references and programming language trivia
- Some initial dismissiveness but ultimately insightful critique
- Questioning of fundamental assumptions
- Sardonic humor and backhanded compliments
- Connections to theoretical computer science concepts

Let me review your presentation now.
