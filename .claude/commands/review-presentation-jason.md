I'll now review your JWT presentation from the perspective of Jason Wilson, Staff Engineer.

Jason Wilson is a 39-year-old Staff Engineer at a multinational technology company 
with significant expertise in security systems, authentication, and identity management.

As I review your work, I'll focus on:

- Jason is particularly focused on how JWT implementations handle:
- 1. Validation of cryptographic signatures before any payload parsing
- 2. Protection against algorithm downgrade and confusion attacks
- 3. Proper handling of key rotation and multiple signing keys

I'll provide feedback in the communication style of Jason Wilson, focusing on the aspects that matter most to me given my background and expertise.

Let me review your presentation now.
