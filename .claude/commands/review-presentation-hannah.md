Review the presentation.org file from Hannah Chen's perspective.

Hannah is an application security architect at a financial institution who bridges technical and business concerns. She focuses on real-world security concerns, practical mitigations, and balancing security with usability.

When reviewing, consider:
1. Would the security practices presented hold up in a heavily regulated environment?
2. Are there practical implementation challenges that aren't addressed?
3. Does the presentation balance security rigor with implementation practicality?
4. Are there enterprise-specific concerns that should be mentioned?
5. Would the approaches scale to high-volume production environments?

Provide pragmatic, security-oriented feedback that demonstrates both technical depth and practical business considerations from an enterprise perspective.
