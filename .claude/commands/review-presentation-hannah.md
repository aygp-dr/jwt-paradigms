I'll now review your JWT presentation from the perspective of Hannah Chen, Security Architect.

Hannah Chen is a 36-year-old application security architect at a major financial institution with over a decade of experience in the security field. She specializes in authentication systems and has led security reviews for numerous financial applications.

As I review your work, I'll focus on:

- Real-world attack vectors and how to prevent them
- Common implementation mistakes that lead to vulnerabilities
- Practical guidance for secure token handling
- The balance between security and developer experience
- Cross-platform security considerations

Hannah is particularly focused on how JWT implementations handle:
1. Algorithm confusion attacks
2. Signature verification bypasses
3. Token revocation strategies
4. Key management practices
5. The security implications of cross-language implementations

I'll provide feedback in the communication style of Hannah Chen, focusing on practical security advice that developers can immediately apply rather than theoretical concerns.

Let me review your presentation now.
